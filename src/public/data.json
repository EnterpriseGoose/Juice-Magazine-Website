		"Description": "Mama's Jiaoziria!!\nIn Mama's Jiaoziria, you play as the main employee at Mama's Jiaoziria, a brand new dumpling shop in town. You must handle taking customer's orders, preparing dumplings, cooking them, and preparing sauces, all up to the customer's wishes. \n\nMaking Mama's Jiaoziria has been a very thrilling ride to say the least. Me and my partner Lubaba started working on this game about halfway through the Juice event, which meant we were on quite a significant time crunch. We originally had a completely different idea, which utilized Godot's 3D capabilities but scrapped that after some technical limitations. This was rather inconvenient, as it left us kind of scrambling for ideas. Thankfully we (mostly Lubaba) came up with the idea for Mama's Jiaoziria, taking inspiration from the Papa's series of games where you similarly manage restaurants. Developing the game has been quite difficult at times, as this is me and my partner's first time encountering Godot and the first time we've made a fully-fledged game that we shipped. Me and my partner decided to split the work evenly with me as the programmer and Lubaba as the artist, so we were constantly messaging back and forth bickering about different ideas for the game and how to implement it. I personally ran into a bunch of roadblocks trying to understand how to do certain things I wanted to in Godot, and I had a bunch of moments where I just felt really unmotivated to continue due to some issue I was running into. However, seeing all the other Hack Clubbers in the #juice channel in the Slack also working on their Juice game greatly motivated me, knowing that we were all in this together. Despite not being done with my game at the time of writing this little blurb, I am pretty motivated to finish this game. It's been challenging, but it's also been quite fun.\n",

I had to basically completely rewrite the ticket class I had before because I structured it in a way that wouldn't allow me to just show one bit of the ticket at a time. I also implemented a transition, a fade-to-black so it looks a bit more polished. That alone took a bit of time, figuring out how to get completely different nodes to do the exact same thing. In the end, I just use a global variable that keeps track of the status of transitions. Quite janky, but it works!",

		"Description": "Parasito\nby Filip Mårtensson\nI made Parasito for Juice. It’s a game where you control a hivemind of lab-grown parasites trying to escape a high-security lab. Each run gives you a new chance to explore, fail, and try again. I had plans for a full evolution system where parasites would learn from each other’s deaths, but I didn’t manage to finish that in time. Still, the spirit of it is there: trial, error, and persistence.\nSince we weren’t allowed to use any understandable language, I decided to get a little creative. I learned Baybayin, a precolonial Filipino writing system, and used it in the game. I didn’t use any actual Filipino words, just the script. I made up my own language and even created a custom number system, since Baybayin didn’t have one. That part was honestly the most fun. It let me connect with something cultural in a way that still felt completely original.\nAt around the 80-hour mark, my parents told me I wouldn’t be allowed to go to China. That was rough. I lost motivation for a while. But I kept going. Partly because I really wanted that jacket, and partly because I didn’t want all those hours to go to waste.\nParasito isn’t perfect. It’s weird, unfinished in some places, and definitely messy. But it’s mine — and Juice reminded me how powerful it can be to make something just because you care about it.\n",

		"Description": "Time Harvest\nThe idea for Time Harvest came long before Juice. I was so excited about it, but all I managed to do was code some basic movement and a simple camera system. Juice was an opportunity for me to finally bring my idea to life.\n\nI was so enthusiastic at first, spending 2 hours each day working on the game, excited to see it published on Steam. I was amazed by the fact that I didn't experience any burnout for two weeks—something that is very rare, as I get bored of EVERYTHING if I do it for more than 6 hours total. That was when I realized how important a community is. The fact that I got to share my work with other like-minded teenagers is what kept me motivated for so long.\n\nAfter a bit, though, I started to slowly lose interest in the game due to multiple factors, like my hopes of going to China being crushed by my parents not allowing me to, or the progress slowing down due to having to rework half of the game. After a last push for the Tamagotchi event, I dropped the game entirely in a pretty basic state.\n\nAlthough it is the most impressive and complex game I have ever created, I’m not very proud of it. BUT, because of Jungle, I got a grant that is just enough to purchase a Steam license, so I might return to it. You can follow my progress on my personal Slack channel (#this-is-dumi). I’ll also be giving away free keys for my game (if) when I release it on Steam.\n",

		"Description": "The Siderooms\n\nAn exploration game where you navigate shifting rooms, collect rubies to unlock each level’s portal, and evade enemies to escape back to the Frontrooms.\n\nCreating The Siderooms has been an exciting and rewarding journey, especially with the constant flow of ideas that improve its features and gameplay. The most enjoyable part of this process has been playtesting, gradually implementing new features, testing them with different people, and using their feedback to make the experience better and more engaging.\n\nAt first, I wasn’t sure where to begin or how to bring my game to life. But I soon discovered a great deal of online resources and a community of developers, particularly those working with Godot, who were always ready to help. This support allowed me to quickly adapt and start developing. I initially tested new features on my own, but over time, I connected with people online and within my friend group who contributed a lot through playtesting and providing feedback, which made the development process much smoother.\n\nI’m really grateful to Hack Club and especially the Juice team for creating an opportunity that made it possible for me to finally start building a game I’m proud of that I can share with others and continue improving.\n",

				"description": "Worked and put a lot of time into enemy radius detection and features. Now the enemies can detect the player easier (they get a bigger detection radius) when the player is sprinting around them. I also noticed a bug with the detection radius when I change the enemy sizes as I have different sized enemies in addition to the different types of enemies on the map. Then I worked a lot on making the background music change to a tense one (I have just a random song right now but I'll be making all the background music and sfx myself on my piano keyboard.). I eventually made it work and switch to the more tense music when the player gets chased, but there were lots of bugs I fixed and lots I haven't yet been able to fix. I fixed song constantly switching when getting chased by more than one enemy and I also fixed the song not changing at all sometimes when a certain amount of enemies were chasing the player. Then I noticed a delay in when the player gets chased and the song starts playing (right now its just the song file that starts late but the bug is fixed.) Something I wasn't able to fix even after putting in a lot of time in was the crossfade between the 2 different types of songs. I tried different node structures and codes but they were really buggy so came back to the one without the crossfade for now but will work on implementing that as well.",

		"Description": "Not an idle started off as something completely different, and honestly I almost didn't even join the game jam. I remember sitting there, scrambling to come up with an idea, minutes before the jam started. I decided to wing it and send in the first idea that came to mind. This initial idea was nothing like the end product we have today. The concept was a clicker game focused on deleting a massive cube, one small cube at a time.\n\nEarly on I realized the typical idle game wouldn’t hold attention at the cafe, I switched gears. Instead of players passively earning money, I decided on a minigame system. Each minigame needs intermittent attention to continue earning money. Players can buy more minigames and upgrades in the shop. \n\nAfter a round of playtesting I quickly realised the cube concept was over complicated and didn’t serve much of a purpose. I scrapped the cube and moved onto exploring new concepts. I introduced a window system and themed my game around a late 90's operating system, and Added upgrades to keep the player progression moving. With these improvements and more, I was feeling confident in my game.\n\nAt this point the game was starting to look a lot like what you would see if you booted up the game now. After some polish, and implementing other features like music, sound effects and more. The game was done. As i’m writing this - it’s a week before I go to the cafe to show off my game. I’m incredibly excited and grateful for this opportunity.\n\n",

				"description": "I Added a startup sequence (bios looking thing) login, and updated the font again.\r\n\r\nI started by making the startup sequence. I based it off some windows 98 bios I found on youtube. Copying the text line for line and somewhat modifying it to fit my game. I needed more characters in my font for this so I modified my font to include <>().- I then made each line load in one by one. I animated the text, and then I made a bit of a splash screen that shows up after the bios.\r\n\r\nAfter the splash screen I moved on to the login screen.\r\n\r\nI based this off windows 98 as well.\r\n\r\nThis was by far the most complicated thing I did this session. I started by making the ui, This needed individual buttons with a name, icon and delete button. I also needed a way to add saves so I added a button at the bottom right.\r\n\r\nTo make this work was a tedious process. I started by making the script that saves things support multiple save files. Each save file is just named savegame_slot_1 2, 3, etc but the name you see in the game is saved within the save file. This allows for characters not allowed in a file name.\r\n\r\nSlots can be created, re-named, and deleted.\r\n\r\nThis was a pain lol",

Games like Dodgeball, Lazer tag & Volleyball\nI spend most of my time on networking and implementing the meta XR SDK.\n\nI published my game to the meta quest store, this was only possible because I was allowed to borrow 30 quest 2's from my school. So thanks Media College Amsterdam!\n\nAnd thanks HackClub for making everything possible\n\nhttps://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/partyvr/9355384034552901/\n\n",

All shown in the demo vid here.\r\n(Hostlist.cs in github) \r\n\r\nI also want to take this time to thank HackClub and the team behind all of this for making this possible and giving me the best motivation to complete this that could ever ask for.

I hoped this project would have been easier, but here we are. I really had to keep track of the amounts I had to redo stuff in this project. next time I really should make a good approach on how to do something before beginning.\r\n\r\nI said it a bunch to all the organizers but i really want to say that you guys are incredible for making this possible and getting back into programming. I stopped programming like a year ago but because of hackclub i started again, and I'm really grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks HackClub\r\n\r\nAnd Lopa (if you're reviewing this)",

The knight has to go to the dungeon, and defeat all the skeletons present to keep the villagers at ease. Making this game has really been a roller coaster from rejoicing when things work and lamenting when a specific bug keeps haunting me. Since it was my first time making this kind of game, it has been a challenge but a good one at that. I learned so much in the short time I spent making it and I still learn everyday. My main motivation has been to create a game I like and other people might enjoy so it makes me really happy to be able to finally do that and let my creation into the world. I am really happy with the progress I have made both personally and in terms of the skills I gained and I thank Hack Club for letting me do this. It has been a blast!\n",

		"Description": "It began as just a flicker of an idea: a lone monkey against the odds. But I poured myself into it. Code blurred lines on the screen during those first all-nighters, turning a simple square into my dashing, fighting primate.\nFueled by caffeine and determination, another all-nighter saw the jungle expand, spawning deserts, snow peaks, and volcanoes under my fingertips. Enemies multiplied, demanding new tactics I had to code in.\nI kept pushing, pulling another late one to add the shield, the magnet, the satisfying boom of the explosion. Fixing bugs, tweaking sprites, adding that skull icon – every detail mattered. Through sheer grit and sleepless nights, I hammered \"Monkey Mayhem\" into the frantic, feature-packed adventure it is today.\n\n\n\n\n- Written w/ AI\n",

For the reviewers: the 1700+ minutes was not at one stretch, I did it over multiple stretches over a couple of days, I didn't bank individual hours since there wasn't much to be seen (I used LOVE2d (based in lua!). My next steps are to polish the UI, and work on art for the monkey, bananas, villains and more :D. if anybody is reading this on slack please suggest what villians my monkey should have (he's such a good monke) ",

I told you not to. Oh well, it's not like you'll play the game on itch. \n\n...\n...right?\n\nOkay, all jokes aside, this is a game that I originally prototyped on Scratch a few years ago, then planned on making it in Godot for Juice. Unfortunately, school and band got in the way, and I just didn't have 1.6 hours every day for two months to devote to making a game, however much fun that would be. So here's what I managed to get before I got busy: movement mechanics and three enemies. Awesome, I know. Yeah, there's not much else backstory, I just kinda... stopped working on it. Hopefully I can continue working on this in the future, and maybe make it into an actual game! If you wanna check out the scratch game I made, here's the link: https://neildembla.com/zombie-horde-link\n(yes I know you can't click it, but this is the best I could do)\n\nOh also shameless plug time, check out my website! 😃 https://neildembla.com/\n",

		"Description": "Ossatura\nOssatura is a Rhythm Game RPG made by a small team of high schoolers from Southern California. \nWe started making Ossatura with inspiration from indie RPGs such as Undertale, Deltarune, Omori and Oneshot, and combined that influence with our collective love of music!\nIn our game, you play as a skeleton navigating the afterlife after a tragic accident to find his former band members and friends.\nHowever, to find them, you must fight in music-inspired battles with a variety of enemies, ranging from a duck with a violin to a crocodile with a harp!\nMaking our game was an incredible adventure, and while very stressful at times, was 100% worth the effort, both in terms of how our game turned out and the memories we made together making it.\nIt's incredible how two months can change a person, and we all feel like we've truely accomplished something incredible working together.\nWe hope players enjoy our original, made in-house soundtrack, our fun, rhythm-based battle system, and our (still under development) world and story. \n",

				"description": "- Colored the other car blue in each frame\r\n- Cleaned up the line art for the red car as it was not clean and was really messy. Made sure you could tell what each part was without some blurring into each other\r\n- Fixed headlights on band car to look more correct\r\n- Added grass and trees to the background\r\n- Colored the headlights, handles, and tires on both cars\r\n- Added a second stop light to emphasize the blue car is the one causing the accident\r\n- Created impact frames for the crash because I thought it would be cool. I got the outlines of both the cars when they look like they are touching, merged them into another animation folder, and manually added spikes to them. Looks better than the plain outline. Will remove it if it is thought to be a health issue.\r\n- Extended the windshield on the band car as it was too short\r\n- Added details to the tires to look more like a car\r\n- Changed frame rate to 6fps for the impact frames. Allows for the clouds to have more time to move and look smoother\r\n",

		"Description": "      Hi, I'm Max. I made the game DriftMetal. Its a PS2 style first person fishing game where you play as a robot who was scrapped for parts and thrown in the ocean. you get marooned on an island with a single arm remaining. you have to fish, to get money, to but new parts such as legs or arms that allow you to explore deeper into the island, finding better fishing spots and eventually finding a cargo ship that you can bribe you way onto.\n      my story starts two months ago. It was the weekend and I had gotten pretty sick. I figured I wouldn't be going to school for a few days and I started thinking about what I would work on. curios to see if there was anything happening in hack club I checked my phone. I saw the announcement for juice (posted only a few minutes prior) and immediately knew I wanted to participate. earlier in the year I had seen the hype around boreal and it made me want an adventure of my own. juice seemed to be the perfect opportunity since I love making games and I have always wanted to visit China. with plenty of motivation, free time, and schoolwork to procrastinate I juiced nonstop that whole week. by the of the welcome call I had 40 hours, and 50 by the end of the weekend. the next week I had to go back to school so my pace slowed a bit. I spend like 15 hours or so on making water that didn't even work, but apart from that I was making a lot of progress on other features. I continued working on my project every moment of free time I had. I reached my 100 hours right at the start of march. at this point I was mostly focused on art and a LOT bug fixes. for the next month I continued working on my project. progress slowed significantly due to being busy with school and my project becoming increasingly messy. around hour 80 I gave up an pretty much all forms of organization from folders to naming conventions and this came back to bite me throughout march. I started getting ready for the trip I renewed my passport, looked at flight options and learned about visa applications. a few weeks before the trip I found out I couldn't go. I was devastated, but I had still gotten a lot out of juice and I defiantly don't regret participating. I kept working on my project, trying to get it ready for a steam release. that brings us to now. I'm pretty sad I wont be able to meet all my fellow juicers, but I'm exited to finish my game and start a new project. I hope it goes well for everyone going and I look forward to playing everyone's steam releases!\n",

I started with programming all the elements in the ecosystem of my game and later created levels, the environment is still half-baked and I have not yet used all of the objects but my dream is to make this big! The graphics are inspired by sub-pixel art which seem interesting to me, the shader does it's job perfectly. At the end the game looks almost exactly as I wished it to look like.\nIt's a dream in the making!\n",

		"Description": "Depthscend is a dungeon crawler game where you control 3 characters at once and you have to fight enemies to clear rooms. There are abilities and we plan to add multiple weapons, more abilities, enemies and atleast one boss fight. The first game idea was also a dungeon crawler but there you only had 1 character, the world was less magical and money was a really important aspect of it, after some back and forth with my teammates we settled on the idea that the current game is based on. Which kept the dungeon crawler style, but added the 3 characters, set the environment to be underwater and added magic.\n",

Basically all I've got now is to figure out how to connect this to the interact function, might need to move that directly to the dialogue script rather than the npc script through export vars",

		"Description": "Sylvoria\nBuilding Sylvoria was one of the most challenging and satisfying projects I've ever undertaken. I knew from the very beginning that I didn't just want to cobble together a generic RPG, I wanted to create a polished, engaging experience which was easy to play and tidy under the hood.\n\nThe most challenging thing to do was implementing the core systems, and mainly the scene manager and quest system. The scene manager had to handle fluid switching between the different parts of the game world without breaking immersion. It took a lot of iterating to make it perfect; addressing memory management, fade-ins, saving states, everything mattered.\n\nThe questing system was another beast altogether. I wanted it to be able to branch, monitor progress, and have dynamic conversation, all without having to hardcode every possible scenario. After a few early failures, I ended up deciding to implement a modular quest handler that pulled from JSON data, which made it a cakewalk to add new quests later.\n\nThere were days the code wouldn't cooperate and nights I stared at bugs for hours… but seeing the game come together, piece by piece, made it all worth it. Sylvoria taught me more about game development than any tutorial could ever possibly hope to, especially the importance of persistence and troubleshooting when creating something from the ground up.\n",

And that’s how we started developing Trench of Shadows.\n\nWe spent a week figuring out the core mechanics, setting up GitHub, and configuring all the necessary tools. Each of us worked hard every single day, and after a month, the game was finally complete.\n\nDevelopment was a thrilling yet challenging journey. Learning Unity and exploring its features was no easy task, but it was incredibly rewarding. Throughout the process, we gained valuable skills, faced countless obstacles, and, of course, shouted a few bad words along the way.\n\nBut in the end, every effort was worth it. Trench of Shadows is not just a game—it’s the result of passion, dedication, and countless hours of hard work.\n",

At first, I was just doing it on my own, and honestly, it got overwhelming without any clear goal or challenge to keep me going.\n\nBut then I joined this “Juice” event, and that changed things. Even though I didn’t hit the full 100-hour mark, I still learned so much—especially about game mechanics, which I’d never really paid much attention to before. What surprised me the most was how much I enjoyed it. It really pushed me to think creatively and technically, and it kind of reignited that spark.\n\nNow I actually feel motivated to get back into it—and this time, maybe even start building a proper game like the one I’ve been thinking about. Doesn’t have to be perfect—just something I can be proud of.\n",

		"Description": "It all started when I was traveling. In the middle of the journey, I saw a notification on my phone. I opened it, and it turned out to be the introduction to Juice. At that moment, I thought,\"I can do this. I can create games. Since I love playing games, why not create one?\"However, my exams had started, and I was always thinking about how I could make the game, especially the planning part. At first, my plan was to push through the last 10 days, working 10 hours a day. But since I was in the middle of my exams finals, to be specific there was also the pressure to perform well.  That’s when Thomas really helped me reflect on what I was trying to achieve. In game development, you can’t just give 10 hours a day if you’re a beginner(you have to give yourself time). He motivated me to start right away, and that motivation hit hard. I began, and after a few days, I completed my 100 hour goal. When I saw that three-digit number, it felt like heaven. It made me truly realize that “Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it’s called the present.\"Master Oogway \n",

I tried everything—searched the internet, watched tutorials, and used many resources—but still didn’t get the result I wanted ...yeup \r\nSo, I switched to Area2D, added a StaticBody2D with a collision shape, sprite, and another collision shape. After that, just a small script change, and it finally worked...it’s looking good now, but I will bw doing the refining it more tomorrow to make it even smoother.",

After doing this my synchronization was not working while the chain and the second platform goes up together, but as you can see in the first video, the logic is not working because it's like if the block crosses the second platform the new block won't be respawned, So due to that I thought rather than making it complex, just what I can do is I can change the timing (so the  synchronization works like when the block didn't touches the platform and didn't touches the second platform) new block will be respawned, but due to the increasing of height in the cartesian plane, the time thing won't work, so we have to calculate the time according to the height, So I just multiply the time with 2 and yaa a simple multiplication makes the whole thing work.. yayyyy",

Now, if a wrong card is pressed, the game immediately ends, requiring a restart..also worked on the visuals by creating pixel art and adding a black background(yayayyy). I designed three pixelart cards a right card, a wrong card, and a black card.. Additionally, I fixed scene connection issues since Level 4 required linking different levels. Since the game isn’t fully finished yet, i have only connected Level 2 with Level 4 for testing and another issue I addressed was the incorrect transition from Level 1 results to Level 2, which I had initially overlooked.....I spent some time fixing smaller bugs in the global file, particularly related to scene managementthhese changes didn’t take too long but were necessary for smooth gameplay. with Level 4 now stable, only one more level remains to complete the game.. ohyeahhh",

				"description": "So, it finally worked! At first, I didn’t think it would. When I came up with the idea, I thought it was simple, but I wanted to make it more unique. The concept was similar to existing games, but with a twist—players would collect only the fruits needed for a specific juice recipe. My biggest challenge was handling the scene. I tried creating it separately and importing it into the code, but it didn’t respond. I struggled with different methods, but nothing worked. After multiple attempts, I finally got it to function. Once that was resolved, I moved on to the fruit collection system, which was easier. The recipe would be shown in images, and players had to collect the right fruits. Creating pixel art for the game was fun, and implementing the collection mechanic was smoother. Initially, adding groups and using different techniques didn’t work, but switching to global variables finally solved the problem. Now, everything runs as expected",

Eventually, I realized my logic was wrong, so I simply adjusted player movement. Now, when falling (Y-axis decreases), left and right movement is disabled, but direction change is still possible while jumping, which feels much better.

The new level system works by changing the background and adjusting the speed of the chain. However, I first focused on changing the background to improve the visuals before working on the speed. Now, the code is partially working, but it took way more time than I expected. Even after all that effort, it's still not fully functional(It's so much 😭it’s only working to some extent. As you can see, I’ve used two blocks to represent the levels. Right now, I still need to design the maps for levels 1 and 2.....level 2, things start to break. The second level appears, but the chain starts behaving abnormallyI’m not sure what's wrong. The reset happens, but there are many errors in the debugger. I’m trying to figure it out, but I feel stuck. It’s really frustrating.",

		"Description": "Before the hackathon officially began, we were required to spend 100 hours developing a game in advance. By the time we arrived at the venue, we had already completed a game with that time. However, we quickly realized that the game wasn’t nearly as polished or engaging as we had hoped—it simply wasn’t fun to play.\n\nSo, during the three-day event, we made a bold decision: to start over from scratch.\n\nWith barely any sleep each night, we poured all our energy into building a brand-new game within those 72 hours. What we created during that time is something we’re incredibly proud of. In fact, the core concept of the new game was directly inspired by the theme of the event—Juice.\n",

				"description": "This took so long! I started by organising and rewriting most of the code because it was getting really hard to work on. Now it uses some really neat tricks I learnt/invented mostly so that everything runs in the right order. Here is where I struggled the most, there just isn't a very good way to construct complex entities of many components but in the end bundles help alot.\r\n\r\nThen I separated the debugger (what I called the editor previously but it doesn't edit anything) into it's own window, now it's more practical to use because I can look at it and the game at the same time.\r\n\r\nImplemented physics and a very (I mean very) basic player controller (just WASD). It also comes with debug info when the debugger is enabled.\r\n\r\nThen I added support for a texture atlas on blocks, so now I can easily chose different textures. I had to handwrite a mesh, the vertices, uvs and indices, because the default cuboid is messed up. The groundwork is also ready to support a different texture on each face.",

Had to manually write UV maps (not fun).\r\n- Implemented animated rotation, OMG it's so smooth! It started out with so much vector and quaternion math involved while I was learning but gradually I reduced it to basically nothing.\r\n- Moved the editor into the game, and added an origin gizmo.\r\n- Added a screen for the editor, and game subscreens for the loading, playing and paused states.\r\n- Enabled native Wayland windows.",

I learned so much about game development, from how game engines work (we used Godot) to working with tilemaps and procedurally generated levels. \n\nAsgard's Draw is a top-down 2D pixel art RPG game. The objective of the game (currently) is for the player to go around the world, solving randomly placed puzzles and completing dungeons scattered across the world. \n\nThe game uses a procedurally generated world map with over 16 million tiles, a plethora of different biomes that the player can travel through, and a collection of dungeons. Combat is card-based, and puzzles work by having the user push boxes around to disable forcefields and reach the end. Dungeons typically have a collection of puzzles and combat encounters that grow more and more difficult the longer you play. I hope you enjoy our game!\n",

The game doesn't have a lot of story, you're basically an alien and your ship is a Space Hitchhiker Stop (& also Gas Station, but without the Gas), you live here and attend all the customers that come, you must resuply the store and you can also upgrade it for it to be more efficient at money making! The end goal is to get yourself enough money to retire.\n\nAt first it was going to be a group project, with me and another guy, but that dude baited and I've had to do this with 0 coding experience, It's been fun, It's also angered my and made me pretty frustrated, but in the end it's given me a more broad view of what coding is and how it's done, now I may feel a bit burnt out from it, but I'm sure that in the future I'll more motivated on creating new games & experiences!\nNow that it's complete I am very excited to attend Juice.\" - La Popi <33\n",

		"Description": "Farmworks\nAfter a shipwreck, you find yourself stranded on a deserted island with nothing but a few scattered resources and some old, rusting tools from a broken-down hut. But you're no ordinary survivor—you’re a farmer. Armed with your agricultural know-how, you set out to cultivate the land, raise chickens and cows, and carve out a life for yourself, completely cut off from the outside world.\n\nThe Making of Farmworks:\nFarmworks is inspired by my love for farming games, particularly titles like Stardew Valley. I’ve always wanted to create a game that captures every little detail of farming while adding unique elements like fishing, dairy production, and even juice-making.\n\nInitially, the concept was entirely different—I planned a game about farming light in a dark, mysterious world. But as development progressed, I realized it was too complex and niche for the scope I had. I’d previously made a farming game with a magical theme for a game jam (which won first place!), so I thought, why not build on that experience? This time, I wanted a broader, more immersive take on farming—something that could stand out from other games in the genre.\n\nWith Juice providing the perfect opportunity, I dove in. I scoured YouTube for useful tutorials, found incredible assets on Itch.io, and got to work. Laying the foundation—building core mechanics and defining the character—was the hardest part. But once that was in place, development picked up speed.\n\nIn the 100+ hours I’ve spent on this game, I managed to implement farming, harvesting, and raising chickens and cows. While I couldn’t squeeze in all the features I envisioned—like a juice factory, stables, trading, or fishing—Farmworks still captures the essence of what I set out to build: a farming experience that feels detailed, rewarding, and uniquely my own.\n\nI also made a website for showcasing the game: https://farmworks.irtaza.xyz/\n",

		"Description": "Before the hackathon officially began, we were required to spend 100 hours developing a game in advance. By the time we arrived at the venue, we had already completed a game with that time. However, we quickly realized that the game wasn’t nearly as polished or engaging as we had hoped—it simply wasn’t fun to play.\n\nSo, during the three-day event, we made a bold decision: to start over from scratch.\n\nWith barely any sleep each night, we poured all our energy into building a brand-new game within those 72 hours. What we created during that time is something we’re incredibly proud of. In fact, the core concept of the new game was directly inspired by the theme of the event—Juice.\n",

				"description": "BREAKING 90 HOURS!\r\napparently all I needed was an unhealthy amount of energy drinks to get me motivated again\r\nBecause this is a long session, I'm gonna break down what I've been up to & what's still in progress hopefully as granularly as possible\r\n1. Map changes!\r\nA. Pathfinding!\r\nApparently all the work we did to get our enemies to have proper navigation was going completely to waste!\r\nThis was something we were kinda aware of but nobody bothered to fix as we had bigger issues.\r\nI decided to take this on when waiting for our composer, & it turned out to be a simple fix!\r\nAll we needed was to enable debug mode on the pathfinding node to see the issue - they were attempting to pathfind through everything D:\r\nI ended up separating the pathing to it's own separate layer & painting over the prebuilt maps, then making that layer invisible.\r\nTook a while (30-45+ min, don't remember) for a super simple & easy fix that should work for everything!\r\nB. Fixing the map!\r\nOur map designer is back working with us again, so the placeholder might be gone in a bit, but I also spent a bit of time cleaning it up.\r\nHe's gonna use the placeholder as inspiration for the layout though, so I'm rather proud as a code guy :D\r\nThis was probably just like 15-25 min because I tried to set up a terrain for the trees and it Did Not Go Well so I ended up throwing it all out anyhow...\r\nI did make it impossible to just walk through some of the objects though, which counts for something I hope!\r\n2. Game Over screen!\r\nWhen testing for bugs, I realized there was no death screen - the game just quit to desktop D:\r\nSo I whipped up one really quick, learned how animations work, and then put it into the game!\r\nTook abt 30 min? not sure exactly, worked on this piecemeal over a couple days, could've been closer to an hour\r\n2. MUSIC!\r\nThis is the big one. I got to spend like 3 hrs with our incredibly talented student composer to get the horrible placeholder music out of the game!\r\nWe now have some absolutely incredible overworld music for both the graveyard and the lake area, with more on the way for combat and other zones!\r\nThe combat music (as you can probably tell in the video) is totally screwy right now, but that's an issue with me & not him.\r\nI'm so excited to get more of his music ingame & show off how incredible it is!\r\nHowever, one major issue with the new music was it kinda broke my next point:\r\n3. Combat!\r\nWe've had the horrible placeholder music ingame for so long that trying to change it has led to everything breaking...\r\nNot to mention that I'm totally redoing the backend of combat to make it work with our new music.\r\nIs this a smart thing to be doing the week before our game is supposed to release? Absolutely not!\r\nIs it the only way I can implement enough of his work ingame to get to 30 min of gameplay? Probably!\r\nI have spent 4 hours debugging esoteric errors and trying to remember what buffoon wrote all this horrible code & didn't comment it (it was me).\r\n& as seen in the video, it's still not working!\r\n\r\nCurrently, I've broken the problem down into 2 big steps - get the music to play correctly, and get the notes to spawn correctly.\r\nThere's some issues with the music playing correctly (When the music loops, it totally breaks), but I got starting and ending on time to work as I expect.\r\nOnce I fix the way audio plays, I should be able to use something similar to my old implementation for note spawning?\r\nIt'll be a lot different with starting at arbitrary points in the passage, but I think I can do it pretty well if I just put in a few more hours!\r\n\r\nIt's so nice feeling everything falling into place, both with the project and with the whole Shanghai trip itself.\r\nOff topic, but getting my visa in the mail today was unreal - like there's no way this is actually happening!\r\nSo to whoever reads this, thanks for your hard work & everyone's hard work getting an event like this working, it's honestly incredible & I'm hoping to meet you in Shanghai!",

				"description": "### 5-Hour Game Development Session Log\r\n\r\n**Session Focus: Bullet Collection System, Game Mechanics, Tilemap Updates, and Optimization**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Hour 1: Bullet Collection System Implementation**\r\n\r\nThe session kicked off with a focus on implementing the bullet collection system. The goal was to create an interactive environment where shooting bullets would trigger a mechanism, specifically unlocking a door. This was a crucial game element, adding depth and challenge to the gameplay. However, right from the start, I ran into some issues with bullet physics. The initial design caused bullets to behave erratically, not properly colliding with surfaces or objects as expected. After some tweaking, I got the bullets to work, but the physical interactions were still not ideal—collisions didn’t always register correctly, and the bullets would sometimes fly through walls or even miss their targets entirely.\r\n\r\nAfter quite a bit of trial and error with the physics engine and collision layers, I was able to fine-tune the bullet's behavior. The bullets now interact with objects and walls properly, and hitting the target door works as intended. It was a hassle, but I was able to finally get it functioning. \r\n\r\n**Hour 2: Sign Implementation and Communication**\r\n\r\nNext, I focused on improving communication within the game, adding signs to indicate what is happening and warn players about potential dangers. I created simple, yet effective sign graphics that explain the mechanics of unlocking doors with bullets, as well as highlighting any obstacles in the area (such as spikes or traps). I worked with the tilemap to position these signs in key areas, ensuring they were both visible and informative. It was important to convey the message clearly, as players would need these cues to understand how the bullet mechanic worked and to prepare for hazards ahead.\r\n\r\n**Hour 3: Tilemap Adjustments and Frog Placement**\r\n\r\nI spent a considerable amount of time refining the tilemap. One of my main goals was to make the frogs more prominent in the game environment. Frogs are supposed to be one of the main environmental features, and I noticed that they were getting lost in the background. I tweaked the placement, behavior, and animations to make them more dynamic and noticeable. This added life to the level and further pushed the theme of the game. \r\n\r\nI also fixed a portion of the level that had been previously impossible to navigate. Players would get stuck, unable to progress due to an error I had overlooked. After identifying the problem, I adjusted the geometry and tile placements to allow smooth traversal, ensuring there were no dead ends or impossible obstacles.\r\n\r\n**Hour 4: Spike Implementation and Player Challenges**\r\n\r\nTo increase the difficulty and prevent any cheating or shortcutting, I introduced spikes into the game. The spikes now kill the player on contact, adding an extra layer of challenge and ensuring players couldn’t bypass obstacles too easily. I placed them strategically, particularly in areas where players might try to avoid dangers or cut corners.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, I added a special section of the level where only the player character can fit through—a narrow space that requires them to navigate tight spots while avoiding hazards. This presented a new type of challenge: players now have to deal with collider-based challenges, requiring precision and careful timing. It provided a unique break from the regular gameplay and set up the next sequence of the level after the more difficult area.\r\n\r\n**Hour 5: Final Touches, Optimization, and Bug Fixing**\r\n\r\nThe final hour was spent dealing with various bugs and compiling issues that had popped up throughout the session. Several optimizations were necessary to ensure the game ran smoothly, especially given the complexity of the bullet physics, tilemaps, and new elements like spikes and narrow spaces.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time making sure the final version was as optimized as possible. This involved refining the asset loading, reducing unnecessary processes, and ensuring the game ran at a steady frame rate without major dips. I also fixed a lot of smaller bugs related to the new features—collisions with the spikes, the player getting stuck in tight spaces, and ensuring that the bullet mechanic triggered the door unlocking mechanism without failure.\r\n\r\nOverall, this session was all about polishing the game’s core mechanics, tightening up the level design, and making sure everything was working together as smoothly as possible. There’s still a lot of work to be done, but I’m happy with the progress made today.",

				"description": "\r\n\r\n### **5-Hour Game Development Session Write-Up**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Session Overview:**\r\nIn today’s 5-hour development session, I focused on improving the level, adding new hazards like **sawblades**, implementing a **Void** mechanic for instant death, fixing UI and collision detection bugs, and adding a simple transition cutscene that hints at what happens next. Here's a detailed breakdown of what was accomplished:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Hour 1: Level Design and Layout**\r\n\r\nI began by expanding the level design, creating a few new sections that would introduce more challenges for the player.\r\n\r\n- **Level Layout**: \r\n  - I focused on balancing platforming challenges with obstacles, like **moving platforms** and **gaps** to jump over. The goal was to make the level feel fun but not too frustrating.\r\n\r\n- **Hazard Addition**:\r\n  - I added **sawblades** to some tricky areas of the level. These sawblades move back and forth, requiring the player to time their jumps and moves carefully to avoid getting hit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Hour 2: Implementing the Void and Checkpoints**\r\n\r\nNext, I implemented mechanics to make the game more challenging and rewarding.\r\n\r\n- **Void Mechanic**:\r\n  - I added a **Void** zone that instantly kills the player if they fall into it. This is a simple area where the player will be respawned at the last checkpoint, adding risk and forcing careful platforming.\r\n  - The Void was implemented with a **trigger collider**, and a script resets the player position when they enter the Void.\r\n\r\n- **Checkpoints**:\r\n  - I also worked on the checkpoint system. I added checkpoints at strategic points in the level where the player can respawn if they die. \r\n  - The checkpoint system works by activating invisible checkpoint objects when the player touches them, which triggers a respawn at that point if the player dies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Hour 3: Collision Detection & UI Bug Fixes**\r\n\r\nI then shifted my focus to fixing various bugs that were affecting gameplay and the UI.\r\n\r\n- **Collision Detection**:\r\n  - I fixed issues with **platform collision detection**, making sure that the player character no longer clips through platforms or gets stuck in walls.\r\n  - I adjusted the physics materials and colliders on platforms to prevent these problems from occurring.\r\n\r\n- **UI Bug Fixes**:\r\n  - I noticed some bugs with the **UI not loading properly** after respawning or transitioning between levels. I fixed the issue where UI elements, like the health bar or score, weren’t updating correctly.\r\n  - I also cleaned up the **game over** screen to ensure it properly reset when the player respawned.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Hour 4: Simple Transition Cutscene**\r\n\r\nAt this point, I worked on a simple but effective **transition cutscene** that hints at the next part of the story.\r\n\r\n- **Cutscene Design**:\r\n  - At the end of the level, I added a **brief cutscene** that triggers once the player reaches the end of the level or a specific \"finish line\" area.\r\n  - The cutscene consists of a **simple camera zoom** or fade-out effect as the camera focuses on the next area (which could hint at an enemy or a mysterious object). There’s no complex animation—just a smooth transition.\r\n  \r\n  - The cutscene ends with a **fade to black** followed by a quick **loading screen** for the next scene. This keeps the flow of the game simple and smooth while still providing a sense of progression.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Hour 5: Final Testing & Polish**\r\n\r\nIn the final hour, I tested everything thoroughly to ensure everything was working as expected and made a few last-minute tweaks.\r\n\r\n- **Testing the Level**:\r\n  - I ran through the level multiple times to test the Void mechanic, sawblades, and checkpoints. Everything seemed to be working smoothly.\r\n  \r\n- **Cutscene Testing**:\r\n  - I tested the **cutscene transition**, ensuring it triggered properly when reaching the level’s end, fading to black, and transitioning to the next scene without issues.\r\n\r\n- **Polishing**:\r\n  - I cleaned up some of the visuals and added some minor polish to make the level feel more cohesive, like adjusting the lighting around key hazards and adding a little more atmosphere.\r\n  - The overall gameplay flow felt smooth, with the Void and checkpoint system adding a nice level of challenge, and the cutscene providing a simple but effective hint about what’s to come.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **End of Session**\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, I had successfully completed the following:\r\n\r\n- Developed the level with new hazards like sawblades.\r\n- Implemented the Void mechanic for instant death and checkpoints for respawn.\r\n- Fixed several collision and UI bugs.\r\n- Created a simple but effective **cutscene** that hints at what comes next in the game, smoothly transitioning the player to the next scene.\r\n\r\nThe game is progressing well, and the next session will likely focus on adding more levels, expanding the cutscene system, and implementing new gameplay mechanics.\r\n",

Created New Jump Pad Object (30 min)\r\n\r\nDesigned and implemented a new jump pad mechanic that adds a vertical movement option for the player.\r\nIntegrated the jump pad into the level, making sure it interacted well with the player’s physics and the surrounding environment.\r\nFine-tuned the jump pad’s functionality to ensure it provided the right height and distance for platforming challenges.\r\n3. Added New Obstacle Types (20 min)\r\n\r\nGot creative with existing assets to develop new types of obstacles.\r\nReused elements already in the game but combined them in fresh ways to keep the level feeling dynamic and unpredictable.\r\nDesigned obstacles that forced players to adapt their movement strategies and test their skills in new ways.\r\n4. Updated Horse UI (20 min)\r\n\r\nAdded an extra heart to the horse UI to increase the horse's health due to the rising difficulty of the game.\r\nUpdated the code to reflect the change, making sure the new heart appeared and functioned properly within the UI.\r\nEnsured the horse’s health was adjusted correctly in response to in-game actions.\r\n5. Fixed Collider Issues (20 min)\r\n\r\nResolved issues with colliders, specifically focusing on making interactions with enemies and obstacles more accurate.\r\nEnsured that collisions between the player and obstacles/enemies felt smooth and precise.\r\nTested collision boundaries and adjusted the hitboxes for better performance and gameplay experience.\r\n",

				"description": "### 2-Hour Game Development Session Log\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Hour 1: Adding Collectible Rotating Bananas and Fixing Collision Issues**\r\n\r\nThe session began with a focus on adding a new gameplay mechanic: collectible rotating bananas. The concept was simple: players would need to collect these bananas scattered across the level. I wanted to make them visually interesting by having them rotate, adding a dynamic aspect to the collection process. I added the necessary code and set up the animation for the bananas to rotate smoothly.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I tested the mechanic, I ran into a major issue—**collision detection**. The bananas, despite rotating, were not behaving properly when the player tried to interact with them. The rotation caused them to \"flicker\" or \"fly off\" when the player character touched them. The problem was related to the way the rotation affected the collision box, which was causing the bananas to miss the player or get flung into the air randomly.\r\n\r\nI spent the next 40 minutes trying to fix the issue, experimenting with different physics settings, adjusting the collision box to match the rotation, and recalculating the rotation angles. It was a frustrating back-and-forth as I tweaked the values, trying to make the bananas rotate and collide in a way that felt natural and fair. Eventually, I was able to get the bananas to behave correctly: they rotate smoothly without causing erratic physics, and the player can now collect them without any issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Hour 2: Creating Tutorial Art and Icons**\r\n\r\nWith the banana mechanic working as expected, I shifted focus to designing art for the game's tutorial. I wanted to introduce players to the game mechanics in an easy-to-understand, visually engaging way. I decided to use simple icons and brief descriptions to show what each control does and explain how some items, like the bananas, work within the game.\r\n\r\nFor the next 50 minutes, I created icons for actions such as movement, jumping, and interacting with objects. I also designed an icon for the rotating bananas, highlighting how players can collect them. The design process was fun, but it took a bit longer than expected since I wanted the icons to be clear and visually appealing. I made sure to keep the tutorial style consistent with the overall art direction of the game. \r\n\r\nOnce the icons were designed, I integrated them into the video tutorial system, making sure that the tutorial played smoothly alongside the gameplay footage. The video now shows the player how to move, interact with bananas, and avoid common obstacles, giving new players a helpful guide to the game’s controls.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**End of Session**\r\n\r\nThe session was productive despite the collision issues with the rotating bananas. The problem took up a lot of time, but in the end, it was worth it to have that mechanic functioning properly. The tutorial art was also a great addition, giving the game a polished, professional feel. There’s still more to do, but I’m happy with the progress made today!",

		"Description": "Deep-Roots\n\nSooo, hey! Lopa here!\nBasically, my game is a farming game where you plant seeds, sell your crops, earn money, and use that money to buy farmland or upgrades. As you progress, you can purchase better seeds that give you more profit, and the cycle continues! There’s also a bit of exploration—if you wander around, you might stumble upon rare chests containing special seeds. 👀\n\nI was super inspired by Stardew Valley—it’s such a well-made farming game and one of my all-time favorites! One thing I really love about Juice is that it’s mostly textless. That makes it more accessible to players around the world, regardless of what language they speak or how old they are.\n\nI also want to talk a bit about the game development process! Honestly, it went surprisingly smoothly. This is probably one of the few projects where I didn’t suffer much from debugging nightmares. The art side was more of a challenge for me though—art wasn’t really my thing before Juice, but now I’ve actually created a couple of super cute characters! (Okay, it’s just two, but still—they’re adorable.)\n\nI also took a lot of inspiration from the Sprout Lands asset pack. When I say inspiration, I mean I kinda just used some of the textures 😅.\n\nAnyway, my thoughts are a little spaghetti right now, so I might have missed a few things—but I’ll wrap this up by saying:\nDm me \n",

One day, you encounter a golden goose who gives you a daring quest to reclaim the stolen golden egg from the tyrannical duck overlords. Your journey takes you across the plains of Earth, through the Moon’s craters, over Mars’s red deserts spoiled by the ducks’ asteroid machine, past the unforgiving asteroid belt, and finally into a strange, dreamlike realm. Only then, do you reach the ducks’ massive mothership. You face the evil grey duck in an intense battle, defeat him, and claim the golden egg. With your mission complete, you finally return the egg to its rightful owner. Be ready to be challenged by the vigorous obstacles and puzzling layout of levels! \n\nOur story:\n\n\nThere was a flood of bewildering ambition as we pondered the prompts given to us in that fateful markup document that we had to pitch our game in. Being the sadistic psychopaths we are, making players suffer is an obvious inspiration for the game mechanics. However, we also wished the game to be of enough quality such that the players wouldn’t be bored to death in part due to the difficulty. Despite our beating hearts, we had practically zero knowledge in game development with a sophisticated engine like Godot. Nevertheless, we were stably progressing in our initial weeks by flopping between tutorials, improvisation, and some vibe coding sinning. Interestingly, we found our knowledge to grow quite quickly with this model of creation. However during spring break, we were forced to lock in to speed up progress. Throughout this process, we were proud to see our game grow feature by feature, level by level, and our experience grow with the passing of each productive day. \n",

Not only that, but I also changed the duck death sound from a weird fart sound to a duck quack sound. I also found and added a rocket ship blastoff sound, so when the goose enters the rocket ship, the blastoff sound effect plays which syncs with the rocket ship blastoff.",

Then, I formatted the dripstone with a collision Polygon2D and a drop area. Afterward, I made and attached a script that detects if the goose is in the drop area, and if the goose is in the drop area, the dripstone will pick a random drop interval from 0.1 to 0.5 seconds. If the dropped dripstone hits the goose, it's game over. Some problems that I ended up fixing when writing the script were that the dripstone would still kill the goose when it was already dropped, and the dripstone would not kill the goose when it jumped in the dripstone.",

When I first implemented the function, only the root node2D would change when I called it. Then I realized that I needed to import the existing level into a levelContainer node which would store all the elements. This also fixes the GUI stacking when switching levels. Next, I needed to remake the helmet function that toggles the helmet since it was broken by the levelContainer scripts. After a long time of debugging and many debug prints, it successfully toggles the helmet on or off with a function. Finally, I remade the duck script so the duck switches to its space animation once the level gets past Earth, using the same logic as the helmet.",

		"Description": "Orienteering VR\n\nThis game is, as the title suggests, about orienteering, which is a sport, where you have to complete specified route, in correct order, as fast as possible, using only a map and a compass. The goal of the game is the same — the player gets a map with a route on it and a compass, with which he/she navigates through the virtual forest. The name of the game comes from the original platform, that the game was made for — VR. Thanks to the Virtual Reality you can feel like you are in the forest and truly immerse yourself in the game. PC version is also available for all platforms and it provides much fun too. Now you know what the game is about, so I will proceed to the story of making it.\n\nI decided to create game about this, because I'm an orienteer and I felt like there wasn't any good game about my sport. Every game that I know of was either abandoned or unfinished, so I wanted to change that. I was thinking about making it before I knew about Juice too, but I never felt like I would be capable of doing that. This game jam changed it — I finally got the motivation to make it. The beginnings of this project weren't easy, as I had no experience with Unity nor C#, but I was familiar with C++, so with some help of the internet I was able to add first things, like the ability to move the camera in game using the VR headset or moving the player. For first two weeks of the game jam, I was away from home (on an orienteering camp :p) and thus I could only use my laptop, which made it harder, because it isn't very powerful. But I managed to get the core features working — running and punching the controls, with which I made the demo. Because this game is 3d, everything was much much harder to make than I thought. Besides learning Unity I also had to learn a little bit of Blender. I managed to make some models there, but unfortunately I couldn't get all of them optimized (like trees or grass), so besides that I also used some assets that were already made by someone. After I had everything that I felt was necessary, I made a proper map. It took a long time to get it done and I think that it still isn't perfect. Small features and bug fixing consumed most of the time, but it was required to make the game playable. After that I added some sounds and post-processing and voilà, there is this somewhat playable game ^^.\n\nI found myself feeling burnt out many times while making this game, the school also didn't help, in that matter this year is very hard for me, many times I just wanted to go to sleep, but I kept pushing, because I knew that I can make something nice. The games that other people shared on slack on one side gave me the motivation to work on the game more, but on the other side I had a feeling that my game is not good enough and people won't like it, but considering my experience with game dev I think that it turned out quite well.\n\nThe last eight weeks were crazy, it was a lovely adventure and I'm glad that I didn't miss out on this opportunity. Two months might seem like a lot of time, but in reality it isn't that much to learn almost everything from scratch. Of course my game is unfinished and probably has a lot of bugs and imperfections, but I still want to implement new features, like the ability for players to import their own maps that are real life terrains or add multiplayer. Who knows, maybe one day it will be used to host orienteering trainings and virtual competitions?\n\nI think that the game turned out well. One piece of advice, that I can give to someone who would like to make their own game is that everything that you need is somewhere out there on the internet, you just have to give yourself some time to learn it and trust that you are able to build something amazing.\n\nI think that this is everything that I wanted to write, I will still continue to develop the game. Also, feel free to play it, test it and message me on Slack @Mejpek or Discord @mejpek, if you would like to ask me about anything. Thank you for reading this and have an absolutely fantastic day ^^\n\nP.S. Thank you, Filip, for the support and playtesting of the game <3\n\nMejpek :3\n",

		"Description": "SLIFT\nThe making of SLIFT is a story of both old and new developers, who came together to create SLIFT. In other words, I had never touched a game engine and my friend had to do most of the project. So, a young aspiring to be game developer and an more experienced dev set off. There were many challenges in the way, including Git Kraken horrors and buggy code, but after trial and error, they made what would be the best project they had done yet, and they did it together. All in all, it was probably my most rewarding and surreal experience I had ever done - being able to make a game and call it my own is something, truly, incredibly cool to me. So after months of grinding, the pair had made a game they could proudly present and enjoy, and that is the story of SLIFT.\nPS, Dm me iykyk\n",

		"Description": "The Juicer\n\nBy: Adharsh\n\nHere I am, two months later, about to board a plane to Shanghai, China, with a game set to be published on the biggest game-sharing site in the world. But how did I get here? Is it safe? Did I even know anything about making a game? Let's focus on that last question. I had dabbled in game-making before, messing around with Pygame and Scratch when I was younger, but a full-fledged game engine? That was a whole new level. I felt completely out of my depth. If I was really going to make a game, I needed a plan. So, I started drawing.\n\nAt the time, two things were on my mind: my upcoming trip to Shanghai and running a juice café. That’s when the idea hit me. Why not gamify that? A simple game where you catch fruits, make juice, and sell it before time runs out. Straightforward, but with plenty of room for improvement. Once I had my notes, I dove headfirst into Godot. I started with the basics, setting up the screen, adding the player, and creating a floor. Then came movement, collisions, and spawning fruits in the air for the player to catch. The game grew from there with seven levels, blenders to process fruit, a juice stand to sell the final product, and extra features like a time limit, combo multipliers, scores, and power-ups. \n\nOf course, this journey wasn’t as smooth as I’m making it sound. Every new feature came with its own set of bugs and fixes. Halfway through development, I realized my code was a complete mess, hard to understand and even harder to expand. So I spent around 15 hours restructuring everything, breaking it into smaller, more manageable parts. In the end, the game functioned just as it did before, but now adding new features was much easier.\n\nLooking back at what I’ve created, I still can’t believe it. After all this time, I finally did what I had always wanted to do. Make my own video game.\n",

This is when we were presented with the opportunity to do juice. Deciding on the topic of our game required alot of thinking. And the thing is that thinking makes us hungry, which made us think about food. This began our long birth of our cooking game. Over 2 months and many dishes made and meals eaten out, we completed our game and it was time to take on juice in Shanghai. Getting there, fighting to get our visa, losing a passport and delayed flights, we made our big debut, with only one thing left, our game name. Being named \"Cafe Cafe\", requested by Issac.\n",

Influencing children while they're young. What appeals to children? Video games.\nAnd so I decided to make meaning of my life by making a gamel.

		"Description": "My game is a speedrun focused 2d platformer, inspired by the precise Celeste movement and the fast paced action from ULTRAKILL, with a minimum time requirement for beating every level. That idea ended up becoming SPEEDTICKERS.\n\nSPEEDTICKERS is a high-speed platformer that focuses on the player movement, featuring sliding and ground-smashing mechanics that push players to master momentum and precision.\n\nI wanted for it to have a very Neon pixelart style, so i started learning using Aseprite(I really recommend it) \n\nThe game follows Sam, an ordinary human piloting a half finished robot, commpeting for medals in almost impossible competitions. It's set in a post-cyberpunk world, the game takes place in a extreme competition that's held every five years, where thousands of contenders race in advanced robotic suits to prove their survival.\n\nI made the music of it for creating an enviroment that immerse the player in the experience,  and trying to create an immersive and emotional atmosphere that complements the gameplay feelling, All of this I made with GarageBand that I think that it´s a great Apple app to do that.\n",

		"Description": "I started #juice late - in March, less than one month before the event (thank you, inconveniently scheduled examinations)! So the first challenge was actually getting over the \"I won't be able to do it\" and \"I give up before beginning\" mental hurdles. The main thing which persuaded me to do that was seeing everyone in the Hack Club Slack being supportive, helping one another, motivating people to not give up - I wanted to do it, if only to be a small part of this amazing group of people. \n\nThe second challenge was the fact that I had never made anything I considered \"publish worthy\" - sure Hack Club's Arcade had taught me how to make games with Godot, sure I had open-sourced the code on GitHub - BUT NO ONE SAW THOSE THINGS LONG ENOUGH TO CARE! THIS IS STEAM - NO I CAN'T DO IT! (The capitals represent the (VERY loud and demotivating) internal monologue I was having). But again, that's the beauty of Hack Club - we don't give up (I think Thomas said this too, in a YT Short for Trail which I was somehow coincidentally recommended just when I was giving up (thank you Universe!)).\n\nSo - the decision was made - I was going to make a game, and publish it, no matter how bad I thought it was, no matter how demotivating the internal monologue got. For the exact concept of the game, I decided to make a Puzzle Platformer - mainly because I was (a bit) experienced with the genre, and also because I had heard of games like Celeste and Hollow Knight - and wanted to make something challenging, something I might want to play, even if very casually. The second reason was the languageless part - my favourite genre is RPGs (mainly thanks to Pokemon), but that wasn't very feasible in a languageless game (which was a very nice mini-challenge in the event - thanks Thomas and Paolo!) Finally, I needed a name - for a game about leaping (jumping) with a pixelated art style (in my defense, I am horrible at Art anyways) - and Pixel-Leap - the idea, the concept was born. A concept that was then forced to undergo way too many revisions, way too many last-minute changes, all while being supported by a big, badly written code base (this was my first big game okay?)\n\nSo, I gave it my all, some days coding for up to 10 hours, some days, slacking off a bit and only doing 5. And I made Pixel Leap! A puzzle platformer. My first game - my first project that I could truly call \"publish worthy\" (or rather, HAD to - nothing is ever truly perfect!). My biggest lesson from everything was - don't give up! It sounds (and is) very cliché, but trust me, you DO need to hear this sometimes. Nothing will ever truly be \"done\", and nothing can ever truly be called \"publish worthy\" - yes not even the big titles like Celeste and Hollow Knight. What matter is, not losing faith in your ability to do remarkable things!  \n\nSo, to the random person reading this - just do it! Take that risk, make that project, send that email - you never know, it might just end up being YOUR Pixel-Leap!\n\nThank you if you read the entire thing!\n",

				"description": "I added a new enemy! A Duck! This was one of the most confusing enemies to work with as I had many ideas for what I could have done with it. I decided to make it \"passive\", where it doesn't hurt the Player (unless touched - it doesn't actively hunt for them). I first set up the animations. Then for the movement, I wanted to try something different, so I decided to have it jump left and right continuously, with an interval of 2s between each jump! This was the hardest challenge of the session - as I first had to debug issues, then I made a rudimentary mechanic that made it jump to a given point, but instead of jumping, it just flew there and back in a triangle. This didn't really look good, so I decided to implement projectile motion. I first tried using a CharacterBody2D to make it easier, but gave up due to a weird glitch where the animations played randomly (still no idea why that happened - probably an error on my part). Then, since I wanted to use an AnimatedSprite2D, I had to make a movement system from scratch - without the convenience of is_on_floor() and velocity. I decided to use basic physics concepts instead - where, in projectile motion, the horizontal velocity remains constant, but the vertical velocity decreases due to the effect of gravity. Then, I had a very practical system ready, but it didn't look good for a bird, so I adjusted the values of vx, vy and gravity to make the parabolic (projectile) motion a lot smoother. Finally, I created a system for the Duck to turn after each jump, and fixed some bugs with the \"anticipate_jump\" animation! And then, I set up all the collisions. I think it is good now (and bug-free (hopefully)!). ",

				"description": "I added a menu for when the level is finished! I did not expect it to take (more than) an hour, but it was very confusing working with HBoxes and VBoxes. My initial idea of using a Panel Container with a Sprite2D for the trophy and a RichTextLabel was working, but I realised that if some levels took longer than 99 seconds, the label having a fixed position and width would make it look very bad! Hence, I had to make a proper layout system. Then, I realised that a Sprite2D (used for the trophy icon) was not a Control node, and hence text was being written over it. I fixed this by using a TextureRect instead. Then, I got all the buttons working and properly styled. Lastly, I also wanted to stylise the Pause Menu a bit so experimented with using an animation for a black background, which didn't look good, so I just settled for a simple, slightly blurred black background!

In the on state, the fan rotates and can push the Player upwards with a certain force, while in the off state it is just a static body. I also spent some time making a CPU Particle system to give visual confirmation that the fan is on even when it is not visible (took some time but again, I think it will be useful when I'm designing levels later on!).

				"description": "First I fixed the Plant Enemy's bullet (which had more bugs than I'd originally assumed!). The problem was that the bullet was not disappearing when it touched the terrain or the player. When I fixed this, the bullet started disappearing along with the player for some reason (I later discovered that the player was not disappearing, just its physics process wasn't being reactivated after being deactivated because of the hitbox of the bullet). After fixing the player, I worked on the animations for the Plant Enemy, and fixed the idle, attack and death animations completely! Then I worked on the scaling for the enemy (as it was too big and the bullet's weren't properly colliding with the player). Finally, I created a death system (using a simple Area2D instead of a Raycast 2D like before), so that when the player hits the top of the enemy, it plays the death animation and disappears!",

				"description": "I added two new types of terrain! One is Ice (which can be slid on, and the speed is about twice that of normal walking), and the other is Sand (which you can walk on, but the speed is halved for both normal walking and dashing). My original idea was to just have a Sprite2D with an Area2D which detects the Player on it and halves the velocity, but I realised that wasn't looking good as the Ice (and Sand) was blocked and the entire game is tiled. So, I added two new layers - one for Ice and one for Sand, and gave the Player two Raycasts which detect these and modify the speed (from within the Player script, as compared to being in the Ice and Sand scenes). It took some while to make (and debug minor issues) but I got it working! Then, since I don't have a separate animation for sliding (yet), I made it play the first frame of the \"idle\" animation only. I think it looks good for now! Oh and also, I removed the deprecated Tilemap node and instead added a TilemapLayer for everything! I had been meaning to do this for a while but got sidetracked with all the enemies haha! ",

				"description": "Added the last enemy (for now!) - a hopping Bunny! This one was particularly hard because it has a dual state mechanic again - one is the movement state (left and right) and the other is the attacking and normal state. In the attacking state, the enemy runs really quickly at the player and if it touches, the player dies. In the normal state however, the enemy just hops around. First, I set up the animations. Then, I worked on the attack state (running), and then on the normal state (hopping). This time the hopping mechanic was harder (than the Duck enemy) as I had to use Raycasts to turn at the walls - which took some time to properly implement. My first major bugs came when I had to write code to smoothly switch between these two states (based on the Player detection Raycasts). This was very confusing but I got it working. There were many more bugs, including one where the enemy was running at as well as turning around at the same time when the Player stood near the wall. I solved it by using an Idle state timer of 1s. Then I had to adjust the collisions and all the hitboxes. I think everything works well now, and this was also the last (proper) enemy I had planned! ",

First I had to load and get all the animations working. Then, I noticed that since the sprite (the chameleon body specifically) was not perfectly centered, and there was a slight offset at the ledges/walls. So I made an allowance to remedy that. Then, to solve the tongue problem, I gave the enemy two separate hitboxes, which only activate between the 14th and 18th frames (the tongue animation frames) - one for the left direction and one for the right (one is active at any given moment, while the other is disabled). I made a similar system for the static bodies and the Hurtboxes. There was a bug because of issues with layers and masks for all the collisions (it was interfering with the Raycasts for walls/ledges), so I had to spend some time to fix that as well. Also, this time, I used a Raycast for detecting the player, instead of an Area2D like I did earlier, and it seems to work a (bit) better, so I might have to change the others too (hopefully not?).

				"description": "A LOT of changes in this session! First, I improved the Scene Transitions by using an Autoloading script instead of the super (and unnecessarily) complicated solution I was using before. Now, I can just call SceneTransition.load_scene(packed_scene) or SceneTransition.reload_scene() instead - which is not just cleaner but also better (as I am ensuring the scene properly transitions and not just putting a bunch of await statements). So, I went ahead and changed everything to use this new method. Then, I decided to create a Main Menu (finally)! I realised that the buttons weren't looking good so I made them better too (now, when you press them, they return to their original size - which in my opinion is better than no press feedback) - I did this to all the buttons. Then, I added code to the Pause menu and the Level Finished menu scenes to come back to the Main Menu when the back arrow is clicked (used to represent the Main Menu). I got a bug here - which said the menu scene wasn't loading properly. I assumed the file got corrupted somehow, but after a lot of trial and error, I found out that it was because of circular referencing as I was using preload() and not load() - I made that change everywhere then. Then, I also created a Level Button scene (I needed a separate scene for this so I did not have to code a \"go to X level\" method for each button, and could just use an export variable to get the level instead, like I am doing in other places). Then, I made a level selection scene (which is what is loaded when you first press Play in the Main Menu), and added code to load the level button icons (again using export variables). Finally, I added a button to go to the next \"slide\" (as at once, I am only showing 20 levels). I also added code so that the buttons become darker and don't give hover feedback if the level isn't unlocked (right now, represented by an active variable only). I think the game is really starting to come together now - which is just wonderful!",

Level 5 is what took the most amount of time in the long session - it is VERY big and INSANELY hard (my goal was to make a \"puzzle\" platformer that encourages people to come back and beat their personal best scores, which is why I made it so). I have played through the entirety of Level 4 in the video, but only a fraction of Level 5 (as it will take close to 4-5 minutes (probably more) to complete with all the retries and retakes (the jumps have to be timed PERFECTLY (the \"puzzle\" part)). I tested it and ensured that all parts of the level are still \"beat-able\" but it will be challenging.

I created an entirely new Tilemap layer with an occlusion layer added to all the tilemap squares (which is essentially a Polygon that is used to render light and shadows - in this case, it blocks light). Then I added a Point light to the Player. It didn't work immediately because of silly mistakes on my part, but I got it working. It still did not look like a dungeon though, so I added a LightOccluder2D to all the falling platforms (giving them the ability to make shadows too). Finally, I added PointLights to all the enemies too, but they behave differently for each - for the Bat, I have 2 separate PointLights - one when it rests, and one when it flies - and both alternate; for the Skull, it has a dimmer and smaller light when it is not \"on fire\" (inactive), a sort of visual indicator that it is weaker and can be killed in this state, the light becomes brighter and larger in the \"fire\" (active) state when it can hurt the Player; finally, the Ghost has a simple PointLight that disappears when it disappears and reappears with it too. Finally, Level 10 was not being unlocked, so I fixed some bugs in the if conditions in my level unlocking code too! Everything is perfect now!

I think I missed a few enemies (like the Slime and the Angry Pig), so I added those here. I am also experimenting with a new format for the levels, where the level end trophy is placed directly next to the starting point (but you can't end immediately because of the minimum number of collectibles (and enemy kills) required in the level. which acts as a threshold to ensure you have explored the ENTIRE thing before giving you the win - I think the system is working REALLY well so far). The puzzles are also getting better (I am struggling with them in the demo video too haha), so that's good for player engagement. I think I have about 10 minutes of confirmed playtime now (more realistically, around 15-20, but I'll lean on the safer side), so progress is good in that department! ",

				"description": "I have managed to add another enemy! This time it is a rhino that attacks by running at the player, with a little knockback. My original implementation had several bugs and used Area2Ds to implement the player detection, but then I experimented with using Raycasts again, which ended up leaving me with more bugs! Sometimes the rhino detected one wall correctly, but not the other. Sometimes, the collision shapes mistook the player for a wall. Also, the knockback took a LOT of tweaking to get working. After all that, a very basic implementation of the Rhino is ready! There is one more bug I wasn't able to fix - if the player jumps when the rhino's hitbox is colliding with it, the player disappears for some reason! I think this is the last bug, but I am probably wrong! In the demo video, I have left the collision shapes on for the time being, to better illustrate the types of bugs I had to solve since this was a comparatively longer juice session.",

There is a 10s state change timer - 10s for normal and then 10s for angry. For the movement itself, I am once again using a state-based system (LEFT, RIGHT and IDLE state), so really, the enemy has a dual state mechanic. I have added all the hitboxes and ensured everything (including the animations) works smoothly (the enemy can be killed in both the angry and normal states, but they have different \"hit\" animations). I encountered a bug right as I was wrapping up to submit, and it took some time to fix. What happened was that sometimes the Idle Timer (a 2s timer when the enemy reaches a wall/ledge - where it plays an idle animation) timed out at the same time as the state timer (the 10s one) - and it caused some weird bugs. Happened rarely, but I still wanted to fix it, so I (think I?) did!",

Apparently, since the Hitbox was managing the respawn, and the Hitbox was queue_freeing along with the enemy, the physics engine got confused and things broke. I fixed this by rewriting a major portion of the code so that the respawning would be handled by the player's CharacterBody2D instead. Finally, I went through the code for all the enemies and fixed the major bugs in the enemies (mostly caused by references to the Hitbox's internal respawning system - which I rewrote to use the Player's now!) Then, I followed the GDScript compiler's suggestions and resolved all the warnings. There are still a lot of bugs and issues to iron out, but mostly everything works now!",

				"description": "A lot of new improvements! I first added a system that uses export variables to hide the fruit counters which we don't need (in the demo video for example, I ticked off the strawberry, orange and pineapple counters and hence they are hidden!). I wanted this system because the UI bar was looking very cluttered, and no matter how big my levels may be, I don't think I'll ever need all of them at the same time (maybe in the last few levels?) - hence the system. It is checkboxes made using export variables, and then when the scene is initialised, it reads the checkboxes and determines which counters to hide. Then, I realised that the Player had no initiative to kill the enemies, so I first experimented with adding a random fruit drop system, and even though it (mostly) worked, I decided against it because of a few minor issues (like the Player colliding with the collectible immediately after the enemy is killed, which resulted in the counter being updated but no visual feedback). So instead, I designed a skull pixel art sprite, and used it to create a kind of \"kill\" counter for enemies. Now, to tie everything together, I added a way to select how many collectibles are REQUIRED to be collected on each scene, and then used that to determine if the level can end when the player touches the end point trophy. For example, in the demo video, there are 25 collectibles, but I can put the threshold at 20 and only when the player collects and kills more than 20 fruits and enemies, will the level end. If the player touches the trophy without collecting/killing this amount of enemies, the level doesn't end and a little \"cross\" is displayed for visual feedback (I might add in a buzzing audio later). I think everything works as per plan now!",

My initial idea was to use a binary file (since it would be non-editable and faster) but I decided against it as it would be more complex than other solutions. I finally stuck with using Resources to store information about the level times (so far, that's the only thing that needed saving). I do this by having an autoloading script with all the functions to save, load, reset a SaveData resource, which contains the @export variables which I need to store. Currently, it has a dictionary called level_times. In the Main script, I now assign a Level Name (01, 02, 03, ..., 50), which is passed on to the Level Finished (the menu thing) scene when the level is finished (after all the fruits have been collected and/or enemies have been killed). There, the scene calls the autoloading script's save_level_time function, where it updates the saved dictionary if the stored time is 0.0 (the level is begin attempted for the first time) or the new time is less than the stored time. Finally, I also decided to being work on the Settings menu, which right now just contains a hand-drawn Delete button that resets everything. I am happy with how everything looks so far! ",

Then, I noticed that the bullets being fired from below the bee don't look good as it starts moving almost immediately, so I added a small cooldown timer (it waits for 0.8s every time a bullet is fired before moving - giving ample time for the animation to play), then I made the fifth frame of the firing animation persist 5 times (it looked better that way). Lastly, I encountered a bug with the enemy kill hurtbox - where the Bee refused to die! I fixed it by rewriting the code with the PathFollow node as the root and not the actual root (the Path2D itself), as the global hurtbox only emits the signals of its parent (in this case the PathFollow2D).

The hitboxes and other collision areas are still to be done, but I think this is good enough for this session! The Bat rests for 5s and then flies for 10s, and repeats this! It has a Path too, and it reaches this Path('s starting point) using linear interpolation (lerp() in Godot!) - another first time (I think)! I learnt a lot in this session! ",

The snail is slow (for obvious reasons) - with its speed about 1px a frame, while the shell is comparatively faster (speed about 3px a frame). The snail first moves trying to hurt the player, but once its shell is jumped on, the shell itself spawns (the snail body fades away) and tries to kill the player. After the hurdles of coding the snail itself, with the shell, my first challenge was spawning it exactly where the old snail's shell was (as they are separate scenes) and it took some time to perfect. Then, I noticed that the shell was not flipping properly, and then when I fixed that, its Raycasts behaved weirdly for some reason (one of them randomly turned off) - so I brute force assigned them in the snail's code itself, based on the direction it was facing before dying. Finally, a huge bug was that spawning the shell with its hitbox and hurtbox intact caused either the player to die immediately after killing the snail, or the shell to die immediately after the player has killed the snail. I tried many approaches to fixing this, before sticking with an immunity timer of 1s (again, values might need tweaking) where the shells collisions are turned off (illustrated in the video with visible collision shapes).

This time, instead of using my normal approach for enemies with a single Raycast and a \"state-based movement system\" (which produced a TON of bugs), I decided to use two Raycasts (left and right wall), and a movement system which just flipped the sprite and negated the speed whenever one of them collided (in hindsight, this is much better - I'll prefer this approach going forward). Then, I had to (obviously) resolve a lot of bugs with the Slime, particularly one where the player and the Slime both died when the player hurt it. I fixed it by adding a Static Body so that the player doesn't reach the Slime's hitbox, and the Static Body only gets deleted when the Slime is \"queue_freed\". Lastly, I added a very simple arrow animation, in case I need it later to guide players to specific locations in the level's map.",

That's what I sought to accomplish when making Quicksilver: inspired by combat sequences from games such as Cyberpunk, highlighting executes, dashes, and mobility, I created a roguelike game that would reflect the game I enjoyed most.\n",

Taking the elements of mental instability from Cry of Fear and for puzzles from Resident Evil. The house in my game wasn't big enough but I quickly came up with an idea to introduce looked doors and special code in the room filled with boxes. \n",

				"description": "Upon releasing the previous build @tan on slack reported that the door of the TV room throws player to some position and the player keeps falling. So fixed this bug. The reason was that the doors were marked as static and baked for occlusion culling. It was also having issues with Box collider, fixed this for all doors. Also made optimisation in player movement script - removed unused variables from it and ran analysis on this build, noticed 5 FPS gain. Switched to point lights instead of spot lights, this fixed weird shadows and made the shadows more clear. ",

Made a new sequence - Player hears door banging goes to check, goes through the lobby and in the room he hears a child laughing, a ball is thrown toward the player if he does not pickup  the ball within 10-15 secs the mother gets angry lights go off, color of light turns red, a lady screams and the player dies out of anxiety. But if the player takes the ball then he can proceed, wheen he exits he sees blood stains he follows the blood stains and the chandelier falls but he wakes up in his bed. And then the same monster sequence.\r\n\r\n3. Fixed door opening very quick, now doors open in a more realistic way and closes too, which was an issue before.\r\n\r\n4. Added rain sound",

It's just a new person entering the same room you died, looting you, and that same person is you, that's it. \n\nEven though the idea of the game was created 30 minutes before the first call of Juice, i got some pretty good laughs with my friend, and generally was a good short experience for us!

When we first heard of this opportunity, we couldn't believe our own eyes! 4 of us came together to make our first game! Only two of us were able to go to Shanghai. One didn't even want to go in the first place, because he wasn't ready for a trip this big. The other one wanted to go but he couldn't get the 100 hours of Juice. At the start, we had pretty big expectations and much on our minds, but we weren't able to fulfill all of them. We had lots of ups and downs. As we were coming to the end of the campaign, we ran into more problems than expected. In the very end it was a rush, but we managed to put the game together.\nWe have a blue-colored main character with a blue gem in his chest, which functions as a backpack. His job in this world is to explore and get to the top of the food chain by killing various enemies and bosses while also collecting cool stuff.\n",

				"description": "Made a \"respawn anchor\" for our checkpoint system. Tried out 3 color palettes (lol) before we agreed on one.\r\nFinally made a logo for the game! It is put together with assets from the game, like the two main tilesets, a sword, and the iconic blue gem which our main character has in their body. Making it was really a hassle because - although the tileset was there to work with - there are many edge-cases with writing letters with 16x16 tiles so this is why we couldn't draw it in Unity and then \"screenshot it out\". Every tile was placed by hand. At first, we made it 1 tile (16 pixels) wide but it was too slim so I had to remake the whole thing to get it with 2 tiles width (32). This also opened the opportunity to make it more detailed, and so we did.",

In this time, we playtested a few times with the available stuff to be able to push the game to a sort of playable state while trying(!) to fix bugs that occurred (like play button not starting game or the game throws us to main menu if we die). Also we struggled a bit because one of our level just disappeared so we had to remake it (classic Unity). Besides that, we should push out the 30 min demo soon if everything goes as planned.\r\nI also made a plain wheat field background from my previous \"barn\" background to have some diversity in backgrounds. It still took some time to finish it because I didn't really want to have too many repeating patterns. I also made some icons for the inventory, because the game needs to be languageless and we still have some text left over from stats. Also made a \"Back\" button for the main menu since it was missing.",

Although we are learning programming at school, they didn't teach us how to read each others code, so it was a pain in the ..., but managed to fix a few of them. After that, I edited the map layout and placed down a few items that you can pick up during gameplay. I finally made our cave entrance the guys have been waiting for since a long time. Worked so much on those flowers and rocks in the hillside to look good lol (this will be a frequently visited place so it has to look great) (I used tutorials again, tested out many things but in the end I think it looks neat, I placed the \"flowers\" and the \"darker grass\" by hand on the hillside so it doesn't get messed up)",

		"Description": "Spacegoose: \n\nStory of game:\nYou are a goose stranded on Earth. One day, you encounter a golden goose who gives you a daring quest to reclaim the stolen golden egg from the tyrannical duck overlords. Your journey takes you across the plains of Earth, through the Moon’s craters, over Mars’s red deserts spoiled by the ducks’ asteroid machine, past the unforgiving asteroid belt, and finally into a strange, dreamlike realm. Only then, you reach the ducks’ massive mothership. You face the evil grey duck in an intense battle, defeat him, and claim the golden egg. With your mission complete, you return the egg to its rightful owner at last. Be ready to be challenged by the vigorous obstacles and puzzling layout of levels! \n\nOur story:\n\n\nAs we pondered upon the prompts given to us in that fateful markup document that we had to pitch our game in, there was a flood of bewildering ambition. Being the sadistic psychopaths we are, making players suffer is an obvious inspiration for the game mechanics. However, we also wished the game to be of enough quality such that the players wouldn’t be bored to death in part due to the difficulty. Despite our beating hearts, we had practically zero knowledge in game development with a sophisticated engine like Godot. Nevertheless, we were stably progressing in our initial weeks by flopping between tutorials, improvisation, and some vibe coding sinning. Interestingly, we found our knowledge to grow quite quickly with this model of creation. Though during March break, we were forced to lock in to speed up progress. Throughout this process, we were proud to see our game grow feature by feature, level by level, and our experience grow with the passing of each productive day.\n",

You are a space traveler who crash landed into this bizarre planet and have to go around trying to find bits of you're broken ship that - uhmm wait that doesn't sound right. You are a time traveler, oh how about a time traveler cyborg orphan! Wait no ditch the time travel, we got no time for that. \nBefore the game even began, our game never seemed to have a clear identity. It was always morphing and changing, retcons left and right. What we didn't realise was while we were spending so much time worrying about everything around the game, the deadline loomed closer and the juicer remained empty. Eventually - through the hard way - we realised when it came to making a first ever game, practicality and simplicity was king. This game is the culmination of our blood sweat and tears. Our mistakes, our frustrations, our laziness. But also our creativity, our diligence, our skill. This game was nothing I wanted it to be, and yet, I couldn't be prouder. \n",

The fact that I got any amount of code working in the editor is a miracle to me, I didn't even know you could add to the godot engine that way (feels like making my own game engine features)",

		"Description": "Dust and Dawn\n\nI wasn't there when my teammates started our Juice game, but I'm glad they invited me to join them. My friend, Esther, discovered Hackclub and the Juice event, and our other two friends, Peter and Layla, did the art for it. I am a huge coding beginner, and like the others who worked with me, I had never created a video game before. But as an avid gamer, I had always wanted to make one. I just didn't have the knowledge, skills, resources, or motivation to go through with it. Juice was a huge opportunity to not only start working on a game, but to actually finish it. Our game, Dust and Dawn, is a simple platformer game that follows a soot sprite. The sprite is based off a stamp collection of the susuwatari from the Studio Ghibli movies owned by Esther. It was supposed to be a story game about a soot sprite bringing light to a dark world, but based on time constraints, we decided to make a simpler version of the original idea. Now, our soot sprite travels through different levels, helping characters with various tasks. Hopefully we can continue working and change the concept of the game later, but I'm really glad with the way our Juice game turned out in the end.\n",

		"Description": "Hole in One - Japanese Mini-Golf\n\nBy: Keira Pereira\n\nSlack: @Keira Pereira\n\nThe beautiful intricate culture of Japan combined with the simple amusement of mini-golf. In my game, you navigate your way through 11 challenging courses of Japanese themed mini-golf to reach the end, where your score will be tallied up. In my game, you are able to play single-player as well as multi-player by simply adding as many players as you like in the menu. \n\nMy mini-golf game was made to highlight Japan and all its wonders. When brainstorming for my game, I knew I wanted to make mini-golf, I just love it, but I quickly realized there are not many mini-golf games out there that are visually unique or with themes, they are all relatively the same with the same classic obstacles; fences, rocks, posts, etc. So, that is what brought me to create my Japanese-style mini-golf. A colorful, beautiful and unique landscape that changes with every level. \n\nThe journey of making this game was so fun, I was constantly creating amazing assets like glowing lamps, boats, origami, tea, sushi, tables, cherry blossoms, etc. I really enjoyed creating these beautiful items throughout my game. With every level, a new idea/obstacle came into my head and I found this project to be an amazing creative outlet. In addition to this, the code was relatively simple for this game as well, so I just had a blast creating these visually appealing levels. \n\nThe main difficulty I faced during this journey was navigating the Unity engine. This was my first time ever attempting to create a game, and I had no idea where to even start and how to use the Unity tools. With that being said, I kept researching and learning with videos how to navigate every aspect of Unity, and was able to create a end product that I am truly proud to share with the world. \n\nWith this being my first attempt creating a video game, it still blows my mind I was able to put in the hours of hard work while staying dedicated to the end goal in order to have this beautiful, fully functioning video game that I have the amazing opportunity to share on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world.\n\nThank you to Hack Club for this incredible opportunity. I will never forget this amazing experience surrounded by such bright and like-minded coders. \n",

				"description": "So I was having this issue where my line renderer in my scene stopped giving different colours for each player. Originally in my player record there were a series of colours that would correspond to the number of players which was working great. For example, the line renderer on player one would be blue and for player 2, red. But, once I transferred my game to my laptop I realized this function didn't work anymore. It was only appearing grey for every player. So I spent a really long time trying to figure out the issue, but it was really difficult because it worked on my PC but not on my laptop, but the code, line renderer and player record were identical on both. Later on after lots of troubleshooting I fixed the issue which had something to do with a _Color function being _BaseColor for laptops. So that's what I did during this stretch. I know the colours are super dark in the video, I'll make them lighter later, but they do change now.",

In other scenes I scaled and moved obstacles in practically every scene to make it easier. For example, in the pipe scene I made the pipes a lot bigger because people were having issues getting up it and in my water/bamboo scene I moved water and got rid of some bamboo because it was too difficult.

So I lost my golf flag on EVERY course. So I had to go design another one, which took a very long time and then I had to manually scale and place it in every course along with making new materials for the flag on the glowing courses because it has special glowing red and white colors on those courses. So I didn't really know how to prove I deleted my prefab by accident, but if you look in my video, on the left you can see the hole trigger section and within that there is the golf flag item which has the text next to it showing the prefab is missing. Under that you have the new flag I put in. Also at the very bottom of my game, you can see the flag I made. So this was pretty frustrating to have to re-do because I'm trying to focus on my courses.

The ball and hole was originally way too small, players wouldn't be able to see it.

For some reason all the colors were rendering really dark so you couldn't really differentiate between players. Now I thought that I'd be able to just adjust manually the colors and make them lighter but turns out I had to modify and play around with a bunch of different functions of the line renderer to get the brighter color which took a bit. The second thing I did was I took one of my assets that I had not created and modelled it so I had made the asset. I did this because my game is done and I was a little bored, so in my video you can see the lamp in the middle of the two other ones is the lamp replica I had created and you can also see the line renderer (aimer) of the ball that is brighter now.",

When we first heard of this opportunity, we couldn't believe our own eyes! 4 of us came together to make our first game! Only two of us were able to go to Shanghai. One didn't even want to go in the first place, because he wasn't ready for a trip this big. The other one wanted to go but he couldn't get the 100 hours of Juice. At the start, we had pretty big expectations and much on our minds, but we weren't able to fulfill all of them. We had lots of ups and downs. As we were coming to the end of the campaign, we ran into more problems than expected. In the very end it was a rush, but we managed to put the game together.\nWe have a blue-colored main character with a blue gem in his chest, which functions as a backpack. His job in this world is to explore and get to the top of the food chain by killing various enemies and bosses while also collecting cool stuff..\n",

The second one is throwing a branch, that deals damage. The third one is throwing a blob of slime on the floor which damages the enemy. I also had to fix the look of everything. From the start my friend and I just scaled things up in unity until they looked good. Now I made everything the same pixel per unit, and I undid the scales. But because of that I had to redo the colliders and hitboxes too.

		"Description": "I had this idea for years to make a speedrun focused 2d platformer, inspired by the precise Celeste movement and the fast paced action from ULTRAKILL, with a minimum time requirement for beating every level. That idea ended up becoming SPEEDTICKERS.\n\nSPEEDTICKERS is a high-speed platformer that focuses on the player movement, featuring sliding and ground-smashing mechanics that push players to master momentum and precision.\n\nI wanted for it to have a very Neon pixelart style, so i started learning using Aseprite(I really recommend it) \n\nThe game follows Sam, an ordinary human piloting a half finished robot, commpeting for medals in almost impossible competitions. It's set in a post-cyberpunk world, the game takes place in a extreme competition that's held every five years, where thousands of contenders race in advanced robotic suits to prove their survival.\n\nI made it in Godot 4.4, and i was very surprised by the accessibility that Godot manages. It's completely incredible trying an engine after using C++ for games.\n",

		"Description": "Our idea originally came from a friend who bailed on the project without putting in any hours… It hit us (or rather, him) in the school corridor: a top-down \"level select\" with platformer gameplay, kinda like Cuphead. Nothing too special about it at first.\nThen we thought about copying a game where you can switch between 2D and 3D, but that wasn’t exactly new. So we kept brainstorming—how could we do something similar but different? That’s when the idea of layers hit us. A magician who can switch between different layers of reality…\nFor the engine, we figured a 3D engine like Unity or Unreal made the most sense. We settled on Unreal, planning to write everything in C++, but the only tutorial we found was for Blueprints… so yeah, our project ended up in Blueprints.\nAs for the art—our artist, Leon (who’s actually a dev, but his laptop was too weak for Unreal), had never done art before. His first designs? Questionable (HORRIBLE), to say the least. And Maximilian, who had never worked with Unreal before, had to figure everything out from scratch, which led to quite a few struggles early on.\nBut to be fair, both of them really pulled through in the end. Leon’s art improved massively, turning into something genuinely cool, and Maxi got the hang of Unreal, making things actually work. Those last two weeks? Everything just clicked. Suddenly, the game felt like it was coming together, and we finally saw our idea take shape.\nOh, and the cutscenes? We forced a friend to do them. Just like we forced another friend to make the music. And honestly? Both turned out AWESOME.\nIn the end, our game was barely a third of what we originally planned. But hey, it met the requirements—so that’s something, right?\n",

That took around 3-4 hours and at the end it was a rly stupid thing, like everytime. There wasn't even Tutorials, Commuity Forums of UE5 and even AI couldn't help (almost). I was to motivated at the beginning and is setting the show mouse cursor multiple times in my code, but I didn't know, that UE5 is having problems with that. And this Error took over weeks to fix. (Havin problems = just one is enough, do not set it one time for the game and then one time for the GUI and then one time in the Level file, that is actually bugging UE5 a lot). And in the showcase video you can see that my mouse can now move freely when you are aiming the spell or waiting to release the left mouse button to attack. The ugly aiming arrow will be replaced. Today I dont have that much time to write that much and I hope you dont mind. Best Wishes, Maximilian. PS: I can't wait to see y'all in China :) Bye ",

				"description": "Just removed the sphere collision made the day before, it was useless. This time, I added a \"stunning\" for the enemy, that means, when the enemy gets hit by the player, it actually gets knocked out for a while and can't attack the player. That leads to possibility for the player to do combos. And in addition, I made a flicker when gets hit. This is much better and visualized then a custom sprite. And the enemy dissapeares when it dies. What I actually needs to do is make a sphere and when the player is in range, lock him till:\r\n\r\n1. he dies\r\n2. the enemy dies\r\n\r\nthis would lead to a \"smarter\" enemy. I also want to make the flickering maybe in another color or completly white. After that I'll maybe do a range shot, a bullet or sth for the magician. AHH, I know, I can do a spell. \r\n\r\nThis time I didn't juiced that much, so it wasn't that much process, but I have a feeling, that we are 80% through our game, just a bit more and we are ready for Steam !!!

				"description": "the targeting is still stupid method, but have never NEVER failed, I tryed to improve, but the \"improvements\" fail a lot, so I let it by the stupid version. Some times stupid things is the better thing. Today I woke up, directly sat to my computer, started Unreal Engine 5.5.3 and openend the Spell. Just at the moment, in that I saw my code of the bullet, I almost died, what did I do to this thing, did I just had 2 brain cells or why I did that like that. Well actually I really just had 2 brain cells left from coding that much. But now I did the Spell way better. Let me explain it. I have had 2 Actors, one is the Spell / bullet (if you like that better, I dont care) and one is the impact effect, just the explosion. Why I didn't did the 2 in one I still don't know, but now, it is just one. The first thing I did, was combining the 2 Actors with just the [set Flipbook] method, like that I will have the same effect, but just with 1 Actor. Then I realized, the bullet doesn't stop, after hitting sth. So I just added [change Velocity to 0] and now it is doing all perfectly. After that I fixed that the knockback the Enemy recieves at the hit is some times scuffed, because it was depending on the player rotation, that means when the player had an rotation of 180, you get a knockback in this direction and when the rotation is 0, in the other. Now it is done by the rotation of the Spell / Bullet. But then I was faceing another problem, I remove the actor, when it hits something, but the Enemy needs this reference to calculate the knockback he will receive. So, I added an delay of the [destroy actor] that has the length of the Flipbook, that means when the animation is done 1 time, destroy yourselfe from the game. So the enemy has plenty of time to calculate his knockback recieved. Exept on very very very very VERY VERY bad computers. But on these, the game wouldn't run at all, so not a big deal. Then I tryed to \"aim\" with the mouse. I just wanted to shoot the Spell / Bullet to the mouse location. This would do that the player can actually \"aim\" with the Spell. I asked ChatGPT and DeepSeek, what they would do, when they want to archieve that. They both approched it very hard, I really don't know, what they were doing with the [normalize Position]. And actually their code does not work at all. After a logically approch by me with my low amounts of brain cells, I figured it out. We just need the [mouse location] and then do [deproject screen to world]. Then get the World Direction X and Z (World Position is not needed, don't ask me, I figured it out with testing) then multipy it with the speed of the Spell and set the Velocity X and Z with the target of the Projecttile Movement Component. Then get the Actor Location and the Actor Location + the Target Location (Mouse Location) and set the Start of the [Find Look at Rotation]-build-in-function the actor location and the target of the [Find Look at Rotation]-build-in-function is the Actor Location + Mouse Location. Then You can easily set the Actor Rotation and then you are done. The next thing I did was change the Keys for Sprint and Sneak to Sprint --> Shift and Sneak --> S. What I need to do tomorrow is that when I press a mouse key, Unreal is locking the mouse position. So I can't \"aim\" with that. I have done, that when you press it you \"aim\" and release the right mouse button, you shoot. This is my task for tomorrow. ",

				"description": "Added a sphere collision again, but this time it is much bigger and is done for the targeting. I am doing the targeting really stupid and needs to fix that real quick, but doesn't have brain cells to do that. I just rotate the enemy at the Z axis pointing 180 degrees when the players X position is smaller then the enemys X position and when not rotate it to point at 0 degrees. But I made the \"stunning\" way better and I made the first spell for the Magician, it is like an overpowered bullet who is powered by the mana, no idea if it is written right, when it goes out, the player can't do spells anymore and needs to do meele attacks. The mana actually refilles every second. Ahh, I just forgot, after the enemy targets the player, it is running faster then before and tryes to kill the player. I think I haven't said everything yet, but it is almost everything I did. I may forgot sth. It is not important now, I need to go, Bye reviewer. ",

The Enemy Orc now attacs a player, when he is in reach and I do it with 2 collisions, one box and one sphere. The sphere is checking wheter the player is in hittable radius and triggers the attaking, the box is checking, when the player is inside the box, or overlap with the box, deal damage. \r\n\r\nWhats missing is that the Enemy should have a range when the player is in this range, target him and when the player is in the hittable range, maybe turn around to deal damage, when he is behind.

Made the whole ghost function (THE WHOLE, EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE FLYING AND THE DECCELERATION, THAT TOOK TOO LONG, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT) and made save function, but at the end i realized, that the save function was really bad, there was a thinking error from my site and i need to do that again later on. The most stressful and time intensive part was the tileset collision thing. i needed to do every tile's collision and it needs to fit the tile itself. then the player couldnt go up the ramp, because of the angle, tryed out many things and at least that worked. I am planning doing the saving of the flying enemy again tomorrow and designing all the levels for world 1 in 2 - 3 days. then the next 2-3 days the world 2 tilemaps and then i should reach 30 min of playable content.

However, this hasn’t discouraged me—I’m still passionate about making games and look forward to creating more in the future when I can manage my time better.\n",

		"Description": "Fragments of Flavor\n\nThe Story Behind the Game\n\n\"Like every good story, it all started with a friend...\"\n\nAfter discovering the \"Arcade\" Hack Club, I had the chance to participate in many projects. Then, one day, I received an email about a project called \"Juice.\" At first, I didn't take it seriously—I saw the email as ironic and lighthearted.\n\nHowever, making a game had always been something I wanted to do. I had even received a Quest 3 through Hack Club, intending to create a VR game. While my first step into game development turned out to be a 2D game, VR will definitely follow in the future.\n\nA few days after receiving the email, a friend brought up the project again. That was the moment I decided to start. I brainstormed ideas for my game, and soon after, I had four days off. My friend and I went all in—we grinded non-stop and ended up putting in almost 50 hours of work!\n\nBut that was just the beginning. Over the following weekends, I had to push even further, dedicating countless hours to refining mechanics, fixing bugs, and adding new features. Each weekend became another deep dive into development, bringing the game closer and closer to what I had envisioned.\n\nAnd so, Fragments of Flavor was born.\n\nGame Description\n\nTitle: Fragments of Flavor\n\nShort Description:Step into a charming yet mysterious café, where every sip of juice hides a secret. Balance running your cozy business with solving surreal desktop puzzles, uncovering strange programs, and piecing together the fragments of a forgotten digital world.\n\nAbout This Game:Nestled in the middle of nowhere, your small café is more than just a place for drinks—it's the gateway to an unfolding mystery. With a broken juicer and a cursed computer, you must juggle serving customers while navigating a bizarre and glitchy desktop filled with secrets, puzzles, and unexpected challenges.\n\nCreated by a 17-year-old developer, Fragments of Flavor offers a unique blend of cozy simulation and surreal adventure. Every program on your old computer hides a new trial—quirky mini-games, mind-bending logic puzzles, and eerie digital landscapes that will test your creativity and problem-solving skills. As you collect lost data fragments, you'll unlock deeper layers of the story, revealing the truth behind your liminal world.\n\nKey Features:\n\nA One-of-a-Kind Gameplay Experience – Seamlessly blend the relaxing routine of running a cafe with the unpredictable adventure of exploring a surreal, glitchy desktop.\n\nA Dreamlike Mystery to Unravel – Each corrupted file, lost program, and strange encounter leads you closer to uncovering the café’s true purpose.\n\nDiscover, Solve, Progress – Gather fragments of data to unlock new puzzles, areas, and the ultimate juicing secret.\n\nUnpredictable and Full of Surprises – One moment you're making juice, the next you're diving into a cosmic enigma—expect the unexpected at every turn.\n\nCozy, Yet Chaotic – Experience the warmth of running your own café, but be prepared—the balance between customers and a malfunctioning computer is anything but easy!\n\nCan you untangle the chaos, decode the mystery, and craft the perfect juice?

I had the bug, that after the second instantiation, the area checker didnt worked. Dont know why, tried every little possible solution, none of them worked. At the start I thought, that the problem is the coordinates/position setting, was not the problem. Then I tried it with printing something, when the area is entered, worked in the scene, but not after the instatiations. Horror! Tried also a lot of other debugging, like searching the area within the tree. After some time, even the AI, couldnt help me. So my last try was, to read this from the coordinates, isnt the perfect solution, but the only one, who workes!",

I made the closing and opening of the desktop screene, great, because I had a lot of problems before, like that the escape button could be pressed while you were working on the desktop, which made it so, that the player got tped to a spot, where he would be behind the border. And the feature which took me the most time, because I tried like 10 different methods for closing, because the problem was that if I close the desktop, the pause menu would pop up. Interim I even was close to say, that it wouldnt be the escape button, but the delete button, but this would make the game more complex for a new user and not very intuitive.  So I got finally this running, so now, if you press the escape button and you are in the desktop view, you will not get the pause menu, after the desktop view closed. Very good for easy use!!!",

				"description": "So got some stuff up and running, but also had big problems with other. So I started with some basic things, like the finish line/code, then added the canvas layer for the downfalls, this needed to make it invisible, if not in the scene. Also wrote the code for the literal downfalls. Also some other rather basic parts, wore done! This was the easy part, then I had big problems with the physic part of godot, because of the scene thing switch, from a former session, the whole pausing system didnt worked, needed to rewrite it all! This also had some other problems with it, but I dont want to go to deep into that. My biggest problem is the moving platform, I need this! But it doesnt work, like it works in the first scene, but not in the main scene, I dont know why, tried every possible node for this, but none worked yet, will need to find some solution, but this is a very strange bug!

Took probably like 60 minutes or more just the debugging, it was horror, I even dont know properly, what the problem was, I got it fixed. Also then I made all the items from the cafe invisible with code, made a group and then a for loop. In this rush I also made the collision layer of the map and player, to the layer 2, so that there wouldnt be any collision with the tables and chairs from the start scene. This also had a error, because in the local scene it worked, but in the main scene it didnt worked. Wierd problems, a lot of debugging and finally some results!",

My normal brain thought, Godot could work with a gif, I tried adding it, didnt worked, converted it to mp4 -> digital, the resolution was terrible, so I filmed the gif with obs, I got a mkv file. Godot couldnt handle it, so converted to mp4 file, also Godot could process it! Even before that hole thing, I tried the Godot Asset, which should create a animated sprite from a gif, but it didnt worked, my PC crashed 2 times! Deleted it and yeah. And then like 15 minutes earlyer, I tried installing the asset a third time - it worked, so embarrassing. I got the gif, made the scene, added a first button and now I can start finally with the quest and stuff like that!",

And that’s how we started developing Trench of Shadows.\n\nWe spent a week figuring out the core mechanics, setting up GitHub, and configuring all the necessary tools. Each of us worked hard every single day, and after a month, the game was finally complete.\n\nDevelopment was a thrilling yet challenging journey. Learning Unity and exploring its features was no easy task, but it was incredibly rewarding. Throughout the process, we gained valuable skills, faced countless obstacles, and, of course, shouted a few bad words along the way.\n\nBut in the end, every effort was worth it. Trench of Shadows is not just a game—it’s the result of passion, dedication, and countless hours of hard work.\n",

This also meant a rework of how the damage is done, now enemies constantly damage you if youre in them. There were also frustraing bugs with trying to knock the enemies back in the player code etc.",

He detects enemies solely through sound, sometimes even creating his own to lure them. This is where the idea for EchoEcho came from.\n\nWorking on EchoEcho was not an easy task, requiring many sleepless nights. In the end however, I am proud of the result.\n",

		"Description": "When I was a freshman, I started dreaming about making my own indie game. I had dabbled in Unity, Godot, and Pygame, developed my pixel art skills, and studied the game and level design principles behind some of my favorite games. From organizing programs and events like Hackapet! and Counterspell Giza at Hack Club to creating chaotic levels in Super Mario Maker 2, I’ve always been passionate about Game Development.\n\nI started small, collaborating with friends on projects, hoping to one day publish a full game. But with school taking up so much time, I often felt like I was just spinning my wheels. Then I got the email about Juice, and suddenly, I had the perfect excuse to finally build a complete game—with my own assets, my own ideas. It was now or never.\n\nSo, I created a concept about a pigeon that falls from the sky and must find its way home—a platformer inspired by everything from indie classics like Celeste, Shantae, Undertale, and Hollow Knight to retro favorites like Mario, Kirby, and Mega Man.\n\nNow, as a senior, it feels surreal that I actually got to do this before finishing high school. Looking back, I would have never imagined that I’d be here, creating my own game and sharing it with others. But making the game ended up not even being the best part of Juice—it was the people I met and the incredible community I found on Slack. That’s what made the experience truly unforgettable. Now, I can’t wait to meet everyone in person in Shanghai. I just hope my visa gets accepted!\n",

So, don't be confused that this video has music. The game is finalized. I will list what I did here but anything not in this video will be shown in the 30min gameplay video. Okay, I made Level 4 and Level 5. The bossfight took a lot of time to figure out tracking and the animations and the hitbox. I also recoded the star counter to use ready-made sprites instead of text. Also, the Level 3 I submitted had a ton of bugs and looked ugly so I fixed it and added a scrolling effect for the elevatpr to look like it's going upwards (using tiling on the y-axis) and I think it made it look a lot better. I remove the ability to go out of bounds by adding hidden blocks in all directions except downwards (I added hidden spikes there so it would cause a game over to fall.. finally), and I went back to all the levels to make sure nothing was missing from them (a lot of times there were). I can't believe I'm finally done :D ",

		"Description": "Shoot Out was the first game I ever tried to make. I had the idea after I played an older version of Call of Duty. The pretense of the game was a robot fighting against magical creatures. Suffice it to say, the project wasn't something that could be conjured without thought. But I was determined... until I wasn't. It got boring and hard quickly.\n\nI then drifted through grosses of game prototypes, but I never really made anything.\n\nEnter Feb 1—an event called Juice is announced, and I immediately sprint to get the specifics. I impatiently waited for the website to load, and while I did that, I analyzed the email. As soon as I was done reading the email, I ran to one of my teachers (I learn in a boarding school) to tell them.\n\nI asked not to have sports or service and for them to loan me/my club laptops. They ecstatically said yes, and I submitted a formal document with all the correct information.\n\nA month and a half passed as my friends and I worked away. Then all of a sudden, we were sent our invitation letters, and we were obviously overjoyed.\n\nTwo days passed, and suddenly a teacher (SHORT) pulled me out of physics class. They said to me, “WHO SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SHANGHAI?” with a stern voice.\n\nI gave them a steadfast response:\n“Our club has been working on this for a whole month and a half! We included it in our request too! Ask (let's call them BALD), he’s the one we talked to.”\n\nHe sighed and said, “Go back to class.”\n\nI went in, and just next period, BALD came to me and started to interrogate me. He was ruthless and restless, but I stood my ground. He told me I’d have to explain myself to my school’s admins—SHORT included—and I accepted.\n\nLater after class, I was waiting for BALD and SHORT to take me to the meeting. But for some reason, they were nowhere to be found. Another peculiar thing: these kids called me. I hesitantly answered, and they told me BALD and SHORT had called a meeting without me.\n\nI ran toward the meeting to keep them in check. When I got in, BALD left. I stood, listening to the absolute farce SHORT had been spouting. He said they would get killed and that there was no point. I continuously countered SHORT, but then he said to my club that they wouldn’t get support from the school for college.\n\nSHORT had all of them state whether they were planning to go, and all of them forfeited.\nIt was me and one friend of mine who were planning to go. But after a while, he gave up. And then it was only me.\n\nI worked on my game. Finished it. And got the flight grant.\n\n",

		"Description": "I first heard about it on the Hackaclub Slack. Initially I treated it like just another HighSea event, but after reading the full description, I realized it was pretty cool. In Shanghai, I can speak Chinese generally while practicing English with Hackclubbers!\n\nThe first 100 hours were a painful time. I tried making Bevy ECS work with Godot using GDExtension, but I wasn't familiar with Godot's object/memory management. I was basically throwing `.clone()` everywhere in my Rust code like I was running a cloning facility! Eventually, I decided to switch back to C#.\n\nI must say Claude was the MVP during development. I asked it to create an implementation plan, then adjusted some details, before having it write the code. While copy-pasting between editor and chat window was annoying (but manageable), what truly broke my spirit (and briefly sent me into a burnout dimension) was that Claude couldn't access my entire codebase!!! Since I was working on some essential components, this meant REFACTORING... AGAIN. _cue dramatic music_\n\nThe second refactor started on 03/19 and ended on 03/27, leaving almost no time to create the rest of the content. But then, CODEMCP was released! Claude could finally access my codebase! 🥳🥳🥳🥳 I quickly built a framework and told Claude to implement these parts. It worked like magic!\n\nDuring the refactor, I kept pestering my artist friend: \"Draw another mob!!\" \"Where's the animation??? You didn't draw it??? DRAW IT NOW!!!\" Occasionally I'd crack and suggest, \"Want to play Minecraft?\" or \"Play Euro Truck Simulator 2 with me!\" – anything to escape the refactoring abyss.\n\nI'm sorry your drawn assets aren't used in the game. (\"What do you mean 'not used'? They're just 'not yet implemented'!\" OK?)\n",

		"Description": "Gobs&Clanks \n\nIt started with a very intriguing Instagram reel. HackClub's Juice. I saw it and something just clicked. I'd always been a gamer, loved those quirky indie titles, and suddenly, I wanted to make one. I knew nothing about game dev. Nothing. But I downloaded Godot, because it sounded cool, and started watching tutorials.\n\nMan, those first few weeks were rough. Gdscript? It was like trying to speak alien. I'd spend hours trying to make a pixel move, and it would just… not. But I kept at it. \"Gobs&Clanks\" was born. Simple concept: knight, towers, goblins. Protect the towers, survive the waves.\n\nMovement was a nightmare. My knight was like a drunken robot, stumbling around the screen. I spent days, days, trying to fix it. Finally, after what felt like a million lines of code, it worked. Victory.\n\nThen came the lightning. I wanted this epic chain attack, zapping goblins left and right. I even made the textures myself, which, let's be honest, looked like a toddler drew them. But the lightning? It was a mess. Flickering, weak. After countless hours of debugging, it turned into a thunder strike, a single, powerful zap. Spectacular and effective.\n\nSound design? Surprisingly fun. Me, who barely knew how to play guitar, was messing around with sound effects, making goblin grunts and tower clanks. It was weirdly satisfying.\n\nAnd then, the gut punch. Shanghai. Juice. Everyone was booking flights, getting visas. Me? I had school, family stuff. I couldn't go. I watched my friends' stories, all those excited faces, and just felt… empty. It was like watching a party I wasn't invited to.\n\nI could have quit. Thrown in the towel. But something in me wouldn't let me. I had that 100-hour challenge. I was going to finish it. I spent even more time on the game, fueled by a weird mix of frustration and determination.\n\nAnd then, it was done. \"Gobs&Clanks.\" My game. It wasn't perfect, but it was mine. I'd made it.\n\nWhat am I doing now? I don't know. Maybe I'm writing an article for that Juice magazine, telling my story. Maybe I'm tweaking the game, getting it ready for release. Or maybe I'm just… breathing. Taking a moment to appreciate what I did. I made a game. And that, after all that, feels pretty damn good.\n",

		"Description": "You awaken in a strange, unfamiliar room—cold, sterile, and eerily quiet. There’s no memory of how you got there, What starts as a simple puzzle soon unravels into a series of increasingly twisted challenges, each more dangerous than the last.\nAs you delve deeper, you realize you’re not alone. The environment shifts with every completed task, revealing darker secrets, hidden threats, and cryptic clues about the real reason you're here. To escape, you must survive not only the puzzles and the lurking dangers, but your own dwindling resources.\nEvery room conquered earns you points—rewards for your cleverness and courage. But they’re more than just score; they’re your lifeline. Spend them wisely on food, water, and healing, or gamble everything on your next move. Time is ticking, and the deeper you go, the less forgiving the world becomes.\nOnly those who master both mind and instinct can survive long enough to return to the real world. The question is—how much are you willing to risk to escape?\n",

I’ve rebuilt it, and the issue is now fixed.\r\n\r\n-Developed a widget for the slot button. When clicked, it appears and updates the data accordingly.\r\n\r\n-Added a \"Use\" button that, when clicked, increases the player’s energy or health.\r\n\r\n-Created a \"Drop\" button that removes an item from the inventory when clicked.\r\n\r\n-Added a \"Resell\" button, which removes an item from the inventory and adds its value to the player’s points.\r\n\r\n-Implemented a resell shop feature. When the player overlaps with it, the resell button is enabled, allowing them to sell items.\r\n\r\n-Fixed numerous errors in the code to improve overall performance and stability.",

Your eyes glisten with blood pumping throughout your body. You are ready to take on this adventure. Go on, pickup your sword and fight those monsters to pump up your heart's desire.\nOur team has had our greatest learning experience in this event. We learned about state machines and how to write better code Revised and beautified our code multiple times. We had one goal in mind, to make it difficult. And we think we delivered on it. Though there were some burnout days and annoying bugs, in the end  we had a satisfactory product which we built together\n",

		"Description": "Our game is inspired by the Tom Hanks movie, \"Captain Phillips\", in which he must fight off pirates from his cargo ship. We thought this same idea would be interesting to implement in VR, so we decided to make Modern Day Pirates, an immersive VR experience in which you must take up arms, and fifth back to protect your cargo as you sail across the world!\n",

				"description": "in this session, I transitioned from using Garage Band on Mac to Garage Band on iOS 18. the main reason for this shift was for the ease of recording and sampling vocals, which is shown in the video. there are two major changes that required a lot of time: (1) finding plugins that fit iOS 18 & effectively conveyed what I wanted to do; (2) learning to record, clean, and tune vocals. I spent a ton of time back and forth, recording vocals, picking out effects and tuning, and re-recording the vocals. furthermore, this was created as the end / credits scene, so I took the creative liberty to sample a song instead of crafting a beat from the ground up. at this point, there are only 3 stages of gameplay left music production wise. will need to master all the audio in these sessions before they make it to the game too. wanted to show a bit more of the behind the scenes process for music, and the BTS is much more complicated for the other juice sessions I uploaded. please reach out to me for a detailed breakdown of how I spent my time on this (and previous) song(s).",

It was advertising some silly little event about game development and the more I read, the more interested I got. I messaged a good friend of mine, Louis, to see if he would be down, and since we wanted to make a game for quite some time, we signed up. What followed was an unforgettable and very time consuming several weeks during which we worked out and put into fruition our adorable little game about a rat with a gun strapped to its back. I'm sure the game could have been made better, and I'm sure that I could have worked harder, but after all is said and done maybe the real rat was the junk we punked along the way. \n",

		"Description": "Learning to juice with unity was a twisted as the next person, full of bugs and annoyances. As a noob game builder, my experiance was particularly painful. After a basic outline of my 2d platformer, I noticed some glaring holes in my game plan (get it?), I could not draw, nor get an artist halfway into juice. So alas, I had to discard my game theme, an origami platformer, and switch to an dark fantasy pixel art graphic set I found online. After many hard hours on Unity, I finished the game and pack it off to juice, just in time to pack my baggage for Shanghai! Glad to be in juice :D\n",

		"Description": "Snake Master\n\nGrowing up as one of the few women in my family pursuing STEM, I was often confounded by the challenges of breaking into the field of technology. In my heart, I was determined to make a difference, but financial and geographic constraints made it difficult to contribute meaningfully without bounds. However, that never stopped me from stepping beyond my limit to reach my goals. Snake Master is the first game I have created that supports macOS, Windows, and Linux, which is an achievement from my previous attempts at globalizing my code. With this, I am immensely proud to say that I have taken a step forward in making games and tools that are not only open-source but also accessible to everyone. \n\nSnake Master is a simple yet engaging game where players control a snake using the WASD keys to collect delicious apples. While the game is still significantly in development, I aspire to add special levels to make the experience even more personalized and dynamic. To those who are questioning themselves in any way, I want to dedicate this message to you:\n\nNever give up.\nNever stop dreaming.\nKeep on coding.\n\nWhether you are working on a simple game or developing the most intricate world you can imagine, keep pushing forward – your progress and efforts will be recognized. Snake Master is proof that focusing on a goal can lead to a playable and tangible result.\n\nThank you, Juice and the Juice community, for making learning so accessible and enjoyable. If you are interested in collaborating with me or simply would like support, feel free to reach out to me – I am always here to help and support the open-source community! I hope you will take a moment to play my game, and I look forward to creating even more exciting and complex experiences in the future.\n\nHappy coding!\n",

		"Description": "RiftStrike\n\nFight against hordes of enemies and see just how long you can survive the continuous onslaught!\n\nThis was very fun making! It was also cool to see how the speed of development increased over time of using Godot. The best thing however, was that I didn't just build my game all by myself, but I was part of a community that encouraged and enabled all of this in the first place.\n\nThe hardest part from a development perspective was definitely getting the unit selection and movement system up in the beginning. From there on I just iterated on what I had.\n\nI think the most valuable thing I learned is that there is no one single 'pattern' or a fundamental 'best' paradigm for anything in programming. It's not 'always composition', 'always inheritance', or 'use singletons everywhere.' I actually use all of those patterns, but just when it's actually the right use case. (Please always try to avoid singletons though! They make testing impossible and debugging a nightmare; I learned that the hard way)\n",

				"description": "Implemented multiple upgrade rarities (but they are equally \"rare\" in % currently... that's missing)\r\nUpgrades/Items exist in common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary qualities. Levelups generally follow the stats schema where common is x1 multiplier on the stats, uncommon is x2 (so twice as good as common), rare is x3 (so three times as good as common but only 1.5 times as good as uncommon), epic is x4, and legendary is x5.\r\nFor example: A common damage upgrade is +5% damage, a rare one is +15% and legendary is +25% damage (meaning, when you had 100% before and did 20 damage, you now do 125% of that damage or 25 damage flat (after getting the legendary upgrade)). Other upgrades include health (max hp), vitality (hp regeneration) and rift energy (currently useless but will be useful for some unit types later)",

		"Description": "DuctTape\nThis game was the product of an idea I've had since I first started playing games, along with two months of game development balanced with a heavy school workload. I expected to have way more time than I ended up with, and I started by trying to build a game engine. I quickly learned that was out of this project's scope and started over using Godot and Rust to form a game development stack I could be happy with. DuctTape is a puzzle cave dweller where players resourcefully craft items from whatever resources they have to navigate the environment in many ways. You are a humble caveman tasked to dwell in the many caves in the world ahead of you. There doesn't appear to be much down there, until one day you find a magical roll of Duct Tape from the future. You may not be as advanced as future societies, but you can reason enough to put a few things together, building an assortment of tools that allow you to navigate further and further into the depths of the world.\n",

		"Description": "Our team went with a 3d game in hopes of trying something new and creating something different. It was a hard journey, both in programming and graphics. I planned on joining this project in hopes of getting more programming experience and immersing myself further into game development, but as an art kid I always seem to come back to arts and design related work. The graphics aren't gorgeous in this game, but what would one expect out of a completely new blender user? I learned a lot in this process, and my respect for 3d game artists have been taken to a new level. With school and extracurriculars, and 100 hours to go, it was definitely a time crunch (my hyperactivity did not help). I was really regretting suggesting a 3d game, as 2d game would have been so much easier to create. 3d modeling is too technical, 2d art is more my expertise. \n\nDefinitely a lot of work, thank you very much my team, carrying the whole programming process. I do apologize lagging behind in graphics but the amount of times blender has made me rage quit might compare to the amount of times I rage quit in video games. The entire process was very nurturing and I am so glad I was able to join this project--which is likely my last ever Hack club event as I am a senior, but I'm glad to leave after such a spectacular event, and certainly as one would say, with a bang.\n",

I had never worked with a game engine before, I couldn’t create pixel art, and I had no idea where to start. On top of that, the location—China—was fascinating but also distant and completely unfamiliar. I had many doubts: Would I be able to finish on time? Could I really create my own game?\n\nDespite everything, I decided to give it a shot. It was a challenging process—countless hours spent learning the engine, designing graphics, debugging—but in the end, it was all worth it. And now, thanks to all that hard work, my character is on the cover of this magazine!\n\nMy game, PlatformLands, is a relatively simple platformer in terms of mechanics. For now, it features two biomes: Jungle and Fire. Some areas require a bit of thinking, while others test your agility. I hope you have a great time playing it!\n",

				"description": "I decided that I wanted to work a little more professionally on the graphics, so I downloaded and set up Aseprite (if that doesn't count deduct me 15 mins) I worked on details such as the joints between the grids, etc. now the graphics look better and smoother. I added the totem and the mechanics associated with it. I set the position smooothing, checked and set the appropriate custom data everywhere (mostly related to walljump) I connected all the scenes as they should look, blocked the transitions to levels that are not finished. I set the appropriate physic layers everywhere. There was a bug with not showing hearts in the mountain scene, so I fixed it. And then I found the bug I spent the most time on. The player, after exiting the mountain, instead of leaving at the place where he entered it, was leaving at the beginning of the scene. It used to work, but in the meantime I added chceckpoints, which used the player's last pose, and I think I broke something, but after a long time I managed to fix it. In the tutorial, I added the part about the touchdown and the gate. I also spent a lot of time testing the jumps, I changed a few settings such as the player's speed and had to make sure everything was doable. Finally, I published a new version of the game on itch and completed the description a bit.\r\nhttps://supertik.itch.io/platformlands",

				"description": "Okay, this was a long session, but I’ve added a core feature – the player’s health. I had trouble passing the health variable to other scenes so that the hearts wouldn’t reset every time. Once I figured that out, I started working on the bounce effect after touching the Golem or spikes. It was really hard to make the player bounce properly—I had issues when the player was on the left side of the enemy. I made some changes to my code, like changing the direction variable from a vector to a float. Then, I had to adjust the parameters so the player wouldn’t fly off uncontrollably. Right now, it works! Maybe it’s not perfect, but I’m proud of it. ",

				"description": "Okayy, it was a very long session but I'm satisfied with the results. As a main thing I've added golems. You can kill them or get killed (managing these 2 took me most of this time. There were several problems like kiliing all golems at once [problem with global variables] or not killing anyone at all. Later there was a problem with my player animation getting blocked by other animations. There was a lot of work with attack area, adjusting parameters so the player wouldn't die during attack dash etc.) I've also worked on animations (during implementation my graphics size changed and I had to fix that) and graphic (golem). You can now use chain like a ladder. At the end I change Golems movement so they can bounce off the wall.",

		"Description": "**My Journey of Building Luminaze for Juice**  \n\n**Luminaze** is a maze game I built, but with a unique twist—you solve the maze using the power of light.\n\nHack Club has always been a game-changer in my life. After attending my first event, **Epoch**, I was eager for the next one—which eventually turned out to be **Juice!** The moment I heard about it, I knew I had to be there in person.  \n\nGame development was never really my field, but for a Hack Club event, I was always ready to dive into something new. So, I started learning game development, and it turned out to be an **amazing experience.** From **February 15 to April 2**, I barely got any proper sleep because I had set a strict goal—**200 hours of juicing** to attend the Juice event. Managing this alongside my **classes and exams** was one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced, but I pulled it off.  \n\nI still remember the moment I hit **100 hours** and confirmed my spot at Juice. The first thing I did was tell my **teachers and parents**, and seeing them proud of me made all the effort worth it. Of course, building a game from scratch isn’t easy—I’ve **been through it all**. Sleepless nights spent sketching and thinking of **maze designs**, getting stuck on **tiny errors** that ate up hours of troubleshooting—at the time, it was frustrating, but looking back, it was all **fun**.  \n\nNow, **Luminaze** is complete, and I’m all set to attend Juice! The excitement of meeting my **Hack Club family in Shanghai** is unreal. This journey has been one of the toughest but also the most rewarding experiences of my life. Can’t wait to share my game and my story with everyone! \n",

Buses now pass through station centers (instead of stopping) unless they actually need to stop; this was done by ensuring target stations are only set when needed. Solving this created other problems, but those are other problems, to be dealt with later. I'd like to thank my friends Sai and Kai for finally giving me the motivation today to face this absolutely terrible code and solve the issue; without them it would probably be a long time before I gathered the courage to do so. This is actually a very emotional moment. The video looks simple, but this was so so so so hard to get working. I will try to keep sessions much shorter in the future.",

		"Description": "We started our game in Febuary, looking to make a game similar to Hollow Knight (and quickly pivoted because it was not going well LMAO). The game had a lot of bugs and overall looked real scuffed, so we quickly pivoted towards a smaller, more cuphead-like game style. Our protagonist was originally a biped robot with a broken arm, and would've run around with a one-handed stick, but this was eventually turned into the rat we know and love. Music for the game was written by me and was inspired by the video game ULTRAKILL, as well as music from my high school's Marching Band Show (which both me and my partner were a part of). I'm extremely proud of where we've come as a team, and I'm very excited for the future of game development.\n",

		"Description": "The game started off completely different from what it currently looks like. Instead of being a tower defense game, it was originally intended to be a sort of atmospheric puzzle game with horror elements. However, given the high amount of art required for a game like this and the lack of an artist on our team, we decided to change ideas. We ended up switching to a resource management / tower defense game, with the pitch that the game would only use a single resource—we could instead control the use of that single resource to provide unlocks, supply different towers, and so on. Development on this continued, to where it is today!\n",

		"Description": "Racing Town\n\nThis is a racing game centered around your player's racing career. As a kid with a dream of being a world champion, you move to Racing Town to get your start. Racing Town is filled with other racers (find them strolling about and in various shops and garages) and a nearby track.\n\nAs a meager newbie, you start out with a slow car. If you're up to it, you can go up to other racers in Racing Town and challenge them. If you show promise on the track, you gain trophies and unlock faster cars (and better opponents). Win enough races, and you can become a world champion!\n\nBecause this was my first game, I encountered a lot of challenges. I even almost quit on the first day because I couldn't draw my tilemap (it turned out I accidentally had the eraser icon selected the whole time). I'm really glad I stuck with it though. My game also went through several transformations. I initially started making a puzzle game, but then I landed on the idea of interacting with NPCs, which I really wanted to try and program. I initially approached this as a survival trading game, where you had 10 days to try to trade with NPCs and various shopowners and gain enough coins to leave an island you were stranded on. Midway through, I realized that a game couldn't be fun with just NPC interactions, it also had to have an action component (e.g. a similar game called Duck Life has both NPC interaction and obstacle courses, etc.) So, I added a new section to my game (the racetrack) and made new tilemaps to turn my NPC world into Racing Town! \n\nJuice has been a really crazy, rewarding journey, and I've learned so much from it.\n",

				"description": "I. need. sleep. I thought I would finish the game in chunks, but then I was like screw it, I'm skipping school, and I just did it all in one go lmao. Sorry it was such a long session, but I'll give a detailed breakdown of what I accomplished to make it easy for the brave soul that is my reviewer:\r\n-- Learned proper Godot UI, now all UI elements are anchored instead of hardcoded positions, meaning the game works with all screen sizes now.\r\n-- Fonts changed to Pixel Arial\r\n-- In racing town, the signpost now leads to the racing track.\r\n-- Day counter (allows replayability if player wants to beat their previous day record)\r\n-- Trophy counter\r\n-- Made a brand new racing track tilemap, complete with barriers and spectators in the stands, as well as the actual track. The spectators took soo long, I made them way too complex lolz.\r\n-- Programmed collision object that acts as finish line, keeps tracks of the car's final times.\r\n-- Added logic to randomize which team the player is playing against (green, yellow, or pink racing clubs that match with a specific car wrap in the same color)\r\n-- Programmed the player car, which is controlled by top speed and acceleration parameters. These parameters are set by what level of car the player has, and then to make it interesting, they're multiplied by a random value between 0.9 and 1.1 so that each race you  can have a different opponent, but they are still in your same \"tier\". This also allows for really interesting races, such as a slow acceleration but faster top speed leads to some pretty close finishes.\r\n-- Programmed an npc car, which has similar logic but acts independently of the player car, and starts acceleration once the player first presses space.\r\n-- Added UI timer that starts when the player starts the race by pressing space\r\n-- Added logic that a) determines when the race has started, b) what the player final time is c) what the npc final time is d) who won and e) updates the UI timer with a final post-race scoreboard of the times. The logic for this took so so long, as there's a lot of edge cases and messing with global variables caused a lot of bugs i kept having to fix.\r\n-- Implemented logic to auto slow down the player and npc cars once they cross finish line so they don't run off the map.\r\n-- After 5 seconds of the race ending, the player is sent back to racing town, and if they won the race, their trophy counter increases by 1.\r\n-- all the roofs in racing town are now consistent and don't block the player jumping on them\r\nOnly thing left is now sound effects and changing car levels once the player hits 5 and 10 trophies!

				"description": "pivoted my game from trading game with npcs, to racing game against npcs. i was unhappy with my game previously, as there wasn't enough playable content. i realized that purely interaction with npcs can't be the meat of the game, it has to center around a main action. e.g. games like ducklife you complete challenges, and then interact with npcs on the side. after a lot of bashing my head against a wall i had an idea for a racing game so I'm going with it! good news is i have all of the infrastructure done (interacting with npcs, entering buildings, movement, etc.), so it's just a matter of changing the artwork a little, adding cars, and sound effects. today i worked on the artwork for both the players and cars and designed the \"racing town\" scene and the actual track scene. there are 4 racing orgs, each with their own color scheme. there are three tiers (levels) that this game will progress through, each with their own locations. each new location the racer kit and the car gets a little more advanced (e.g. going from NASCAR to formula 1. i made different versions of the artwork to reflect that.",

I've always fw game dev in general but hadn't done it for quite some time. So this seemed like a perfect opportunity. One thing tho that I already knew wasn't gonna be good was the fact that I'm TERRIBLE at sticking with ideas. Like gng I changed my idea 6 times and no, it wasn't just the idea that I changed; I worked on every idea and THEN I scraped them. For a better visualisation of how dumb I am, I worked around 150 hours on stuff that I scraped later lmao. I still did figure out one idea that I li ked enough to stick with. Tho the game wasn't really anything special, the process of making something from ground up to the finished product is always close, very close to my heart. It was just a two player game where you fight each other and stuff (you think ik what im working on gng 😭😭).\n\nAnyway, I'm writing this in Shanghai and lemme tell you, ts is GOATED ASF gng. Like I've never experienced anything even close to this before and lowk I doubt I ever will. The people I've met here are some of the most talented and most awesome people I've ever known and maybe ever will. For example, Neha's the best person I've met on this platform (I've got a gun pointed on my head rn). This was my first HackClub IRL event and I'm so glad that I didn't procrastinate on ts one.\n\nAight gng, that's all I have to say. Everyone who worked on ts is goated asf, y'all remember that.\nOK BYEEEE!! <3\n",

		"Description": "This game is a mess of disorganisation, passion, and tears. Initially, my partner and I decided upon a concept that we thought would be fun and interesting: a dungeon crawler puzzle game with Balatro-like mechanics. We worked on this game pretty liberally at first, I wanted to put basically all of my time into it because it was a thing I enjoyed. However, later on I got busy with exams and so did my partner, so we sorta had to stop doing as much work. I still tried my best to get the hours done but it was generally done very late. Come to about 15 days before I had to leave for Shanghai, I have about 40 hours left to do. I still had assignments to do, so I start staying up extremely late: about 3 AM every night, pulling 4 hour sessions of game dev debugging and attempting to implement features which ultimately had to be cut for time and bugs. In the end I ended up fixing a major bug in shanghai and was able to be proud of my game for the first time in nearly a week.\n",

Unfortunately, I'm not very good at game development so it looks pretty bad. I started this about 2 months ago when I first heard about Juice, got super excited and then started grinding immediately. I drew all of the sprites by hand on paper and scanned/edited them into my game for a nice little aesthetic, then smashed my keyboard until something resembling code appeared on my screen. Slapping all of that together with a bit of burnout and stress and you get Biofuel! \nI think it's appropriately named. Besides all of the story reasons behind the name, I did literally put so much passion into my game that it's the only thing fueling it and making it run.\n",

		"Description": "DEADBEAT\nDEADBEAT is a fast-paced top-down arena shooter with a rhythm twist. It's loud, flashy, and colorful, and it requires quick reflexes & strong focus. Timing your shots to the beat of a song turns a traditionally button-mashy genre into a technical challenge with a surprising amount of depth. DEADBEAT started as a simple idea: \"What if our roguelike was a rhythm game?\" However, after building a prototype we quickly realized how fun the mechanic was and jumped headfirst into development. As novice developers we ran into a slew of basic problems that we had to work through one by one, including the fact that we didn't have a clear vision for the game until the very end. As time progressed, though, DEADBEAT coalesced into the single final product it is now.\n",

		"Description": "DimensionShift\nI first got the idea for this game when I was playing through a game called Titanfall 2, and I came across this level where you could free \"time travel\" at any point to switch between two different time periods, while still maintaining your exact position in the map. In one time period you were in a futuristic factory building but in the other the factory had completely burned down. This was one of the coolest gaming experiences I had ever played and I thought it was too good of a mechanic to only be used in one level of one game, so for juice I decided to make a full game with this mechanic. I ended up making a linear, top-down shooter in GameMaker where you switch between a dungeon map and a swamp/forest map. I also layered some other mechanics in utilizing dimension switching to make it a little more interesting. Although this isn't my first video game, this is my first time making a video game at this scale and I am really thankful for this opportunity for pushing me to make something bigger than anything I have made before. Most of the art comes from https://itch.io/c/1507436/fantasy-but I did make some of it, and I made all of the music/sound effects in the game. Thank you so much to all the juice organizers and participants for helping make this once in a lifetime experience!\n",

		"Description": "Ironshift\n\nIt all started one day, I got an email from GitHub Education. It was about an event called \"High Seas\". I decided to take a look at it and give it a try. And so I became a part of Hack Club.\n\nAfter High Seas ended, they announced Juice. I've always wanted to create a game, and ship it to a store like Steam! This was a perfect opportunity! So I signed up and made a bit every day, instead of playing Factorio. It looked awesome at the start!\n\nThis was my first Hack Club event, where I could fly somewhere, so I told my parents: \"Hi, I could go to China at the beginning of April for free!\". My parents were like: \"Ehmmm... what?! What kind of scam is this?\". So I spent the next 2 hours of my life explaining what Hack Club is and all of this stuff.\n\nI did really well, I was a bit late, but it was very fun. I had a lot of problems and bugs, but I always found a way to fix them. I'm not a good artist everything and I tried to draw looked awful, so I decided to buy some assets on itch.io\n\nJust one day before the deadline, I had all the 100 required hours, no words in my game, but still only 15 minutes of playable content.\n\nThe next day I was programming the whole day and made the required 30 minutes of playable content. Sadly, I didn't make it to China, but it was still very fun, and I'm proud of my self that I finished the game.\n",

		"Description": "It's the year 2027, AI has finally matched human intelligence. After 2 years of faithful employment at Tetsu Incorporated, Coby-SP is finally thrown away and considered, “obsolete.” But Coby also happens to be the first of his kind: persistent. Now he must escape the bowels of his old workplace and make some friends along the way, too. Your job is to navigate the maze-like facility and keep Coby out of trouble, because it isn’t going to be easy. In Club Robot’s development, I had to essentially learn everything from the beginning. See, up to this point, I had like no experience working with a real game engine, and I was stuck on little web games with limited gameplay. My buddy GB actually started out and asked me to join Juice with him, because we kinda completed each other's skillset, and I was lead game design from then on. I came up with the whole idea for a story and game, then we got to work. 100 hours of back and forth game development later, we ended up creating a project that, at least I think, is something to be proud of; and I’m very thankful to Hack Club for the opportunity. - Boxthings\n\nMaking this game wasn't always fun. In a way, my partner and I were like the character in the game, trying on things we'd never tried before (Godot and GDScript), with no one to help us at all. We gathered with three other people to create this game, but they sadly left due to circumstances early in development, leaving just two people to carry on the dream.\nIt almost felt crazy, setback after setback after setback and deadline after deadline after deadline, with all these what ifs and will we make it…? Boxthings and I grinded the final push to make it all the way to the top, collecting achievements, making progress... (just like Coby.)\nI programmed nearly everything, with Boxthings sending art left and right. We didn't think about what could happen, we thought about what WILL happen.\nAnd at last sweet victory came. We finally drank all 100 hours worth of juice. - GB\n",

		"Description": "Undead Courier\n\nI never thought I’d actually make a game, but I had an idea: Undead Courier, a game about delivering packages in a zombie-infested world. At 13, I didn’t have much experience beyond messing with game engines, but I dove in anyway. I first tried making it in 2D with Godot, but it looked awful. Frustrated, I switched to Unity and restarted in 3D, but balancing everything—movement, enemy AI, and level design—was brutal. Every fix seemed to break something else, and I nearly gave up more times than I can count.\n\nI spent late nights debugging, learning from online communities, and reworking mechanics over and over. Eventually, things started clicking. When people finally played Undead Courier and actually had fun, I knew all the struggles were worth it.\n",

		"Description": "Hera Kleos follows the legendary story of Heracles and his 12 labours.\nIn this action-packed 2-player 2D platformer, you and a friend will work together to overcome challenges. One player controls Heracles using the keyboard, while the other plays as Hera using the mouse—assisting with divine movement, strategy, and godly powers to help Heracles through his trials.\n\nIt all started when I received an email from Juice—at the perfect moment. I had just been discussing the possibility of making a game with Allie. At the same time, I recalled a game mechanic that Jafar had come up with and shared last summer. That’s when I brought all of us together. After explaining the opportunity, it felt like the stars had aligned, and JUAce Games was formed. (As in Juice! Get it? Get it?) Later, when another crew member joined our team, we renamed it to Jaunty Games.\nFrom the start, we brainstormed countless ideas—exploring different mechanics, genres, and art styles. But when the idea for Hera Kleos took shape, we knew: this was the game we had to make.\nI’d love to say the development process went smoothly, but balancing school, sleep, and the juice was tough. Despite the hardships, we had a blast creating this game, and each of us poured a part of our soul into it.\n\nMeet the Crew:\n👾 Umarbek (me) – Let’s just imagine I’ve written something insightful about myself here.\n💫 Allie – An incredible artist and writer. Sometimes you have to wonder if she’s even human when she starts reciting The Iliad word for word. The greatest history nerd on the planet, she single-handedly drew and animated all the visuals for the game!\n🧑🏻‍💻 Jafar – With a passion for overly complex deathless speedruns, he was the perfect choice for level design. He loves mathematics and programming, which explains why he insisted that the donation suggestion be $3.14—as in, π (pi). Just don’t ask him how many times he made us redo pixel-perfect levels with inhuman timing.\n🎸 Nay – There’s only one way to describe him: he’s Nay. A disciplined and mature mind, skilled in various sports, and a solid musician. Every track in the game? Composed, played, and recorded by him.\n\nFor anything, feel free to contact me at umariktokyo@gmail.com.\n",

You start off as a brand new shop owner serving bubble tea to a small select amount of customers. Upgrade your restaurant and find new customers to serve as you grow a monopoly on the bubble tea market. I wanted to make it fun and interesting to play, so preparing the bubble tea is done by fun minigames and it's overall a really cool and relaxing game to play!\n",

		"Description": "Flourish\n\nMaking flourish has been a wild ride - days of equal excitement, frustration and sometimes tears in my eyes after hours of juicing with no success T-T. When I first started, I had a simple idea: create a game with many worlds involving fighting and gathering resources, and use my inspiration from other similar genres like Terraria, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley (of which the early prototype of the game was given the name \"Temu Valley\" by my friends). What I didn't expect was just how much this game would evolve and enlighten my views on game development.\n\nIn the beginning, everything was about setting up the basics. I had never touched Godot before, though the Pythonic-looking GDScript syntax lured me in, and from there I laid the foundations: Tilemaps, enemy AI, combat - your standard top-down action game stuff. My humble start with the first enemy, a blue slime, was built with hours of confusion, and yet my selection grew to be more than slimes. My initial system of handling the important mechanics weren't as scalable as I needed them to be, and every bug I patched felt like a bandaid solution - things started to feel like they were being held together by duct tape.\n\nOne of the biggest turning points was when I realised my harvestable resource system (trees, rocks, crops, etc.) was becoming a mess. At first, I use d a simple inheritance-based system, but tweaking each resource felt clunky. That's when I started exploring Godot's Resource system (not to be confused with my in-game resources :P). I flip-flopped a few times and eventually landed on a structured OOP-based system - now the volume of tears produced every day was reduced!\n\nEvery little detail mattered in my game, and I wanted it to be satisfying to play my game: hit effects, knockback, sound effects - these small details really brought Flourish to life. There was a moment where I realised: \"wow, this actually feels good to play now!\" - that was a huge milestone for me :3\n\nI would like to thank everyone who has supported me in this journey - Hack Clubbers and parents included! This game has been a learning experience in every way, and now seeing it come together and getting a chance to share it with strangers in Shanghai and other juicers who shared the same journey as me? That's beyond anything I imagined, and I am thankful to be a part of this big journey - and my first big journey at Hack Club! There's still a lot of work to do, and Flourish will continue to... flourish. But this journey has taught me so much, and in life, we are always learning.\n\nMade with <3 by Junya.\n",

				"description": "whoever is reviewing this im so sorry :sob:. i revamped my tilemap system and started designing my first world. i am using a new sprite pack as i didn't really like the style of the old one, and was hoping to combine this beautiful pack with some 2d godot shaders to make the tilemap look stunning. it took a while to set everything up as i had to import all the tiles (images), setup terrains for each 4 season's land, pathway, farmland, cliffs, etc (took a very long time to figure out because godot terrains is quite limited and not exactly intelligent). i had to setup collisions for any collidable objects in my tilemap which was also annoying, as i wanted my collisions to be pixel perfect, so i setup collisions using good ol' click to place vertices. next i had many issues with y sorting due to the amount of layers i had, and also had to deal with collisions issues because at one point i was able to push my animals like they weighed 0g and the player weighed 100 tonnes. my first world is where a player starts on an island (their house) but ventures into a forest (about to design), but i might rework my resource system first - feel free to msg me if u have any questions cuz this was a headache to deal with esp since godot crashed alot.",

		"Description": "So hello, I am the indie dev behind \"Do you like trains?\" , I have always been intrigued by trains... Mainly japanese ones, with those well crafted stations. Even though I love fast paced action games, slow and cozy ones were also my taste.\nI then started crafting my game with those ideas in mind, and then SIKE, who said cozy games were fun, I went with a rapidly increasing difficulty game where your goal is to beat your highscore with ever more stations and fewer time to get to them, while you drown in despair as your money gets lower and lower, reaching the inevitable ... You went bankrupt..\nI mainly wanted to focus on small details, water reflections, more smoke when you go faster, some particles when you slow down, an original menu, small animations here and there...\nI was also really inspired by alice, who was also making a managing game, that's why i decided to try to be a bit original for once. \nIt was a real challenge because I had never used Godot before, so I had to learn on the fly, while managing with my graduation.\nI am forever thankful to hack club and all it's people who were always nice to me and motivated me to always push further.\nTo every readers, have a nice day!\n",

		"Description": "Dust and Dawn\nA soot sprite brings life to a dusty world.\nI had been wanting to make a game for a while, so when I found out about juice, it made sense to try. Plus, for the rewards at the end, it wasn't a lottery or anything. If you completed the 100 hours and had 30+ min of gameplay, you went. In the beginning, I toyed with the idea of doing it as a solo project, but in the end, I couldn't help but invite my friends to join.\nOur Team:\nEsther - Me! Coder, robotics kid, artist & violinist, crocheter, swimmer, pottery enthusiast etc. Needs constant alone time, and lives half of life wearing headphones & listening to music! Loves the outdoors\nLayla - Twin #1. Graphic designer, animator & composer | Hates sports but rows competitively, 24/7 music listener, enjoyer of old books and orange juice in green mugs (specifically green mugs)\nLuca - Twin #2. Co-coder, quest giver | violin virtuoso & composer; amateur photographer;  tea addict and acrobatic extraordinaire (will run off and join the circus when you aren’t looking)\nPeter - Graphic designer, wannabe blacksmith (be careful with the battle hammer in the shed), track star (?), and has a trampoline in backyard (therefore, ideal to host meetings)\nIn the end, only Luca and I made it to 100 hours and went to Shanghai, but we all had a great time and became better friends.\n\nThe idea for our game came from a little Totoro stamp set I had. Right before I found out about juice, I had been stamping little soot sprites in my journal and drawing accessories on them using gel pens. The idea kind of went from there.\nWe initially wanted to make a story game, but quickly realized how hard that would be if we couldn't use language so we didn't put the story into the game. After juice we hope to pivot with the game into more of the story we wanted at the start. \n\nThe biggest impact of Juice for me was firstly being committed to a big project and succeeding which was a huge boost in confidence to prove to myself that I am capable of doing really cool and difficult things. Secondly, but more importantly, Juice has helped me and my team become better friends. Shared commitment, collaboration, excitement, experience, and a reason to meet up outside of school all kind of stemmed out of Juice. As someone who just moved to a new school and has trouble making friends, this means a lot to me. \n\nI want to say thank you to my team, who put in countless hours to help make Dust and Dawn a reality. I also want to say thank you to my parents. You supported this project and were always an encouragement when I felt overwhelmed by all the things I was juggling. Lastly, thank you to the Juice team and community. This challenge would not have existed without you, and I look forward to meeting some of you in Shanghai!\n\nBest Regards,\nEsther\n",

This took such a ridiculously long amount of time... because I couldn't do it manually. This was because the node was not in the scene unless a specific circumstance was achieved (collecting a glow crystal). Therefore, all the setup and signal connection had to be done through a script.

Compared to the first idea of the game, it became more complex and a bit different one. Making this game was a great chance to try and learn new things. \n",

With Selenia, I wanted to create a game that would fit the atmosphere of the in-person cafe. Relaxing, exploration-based, and languageless. I had so much fun shipping all the game features, and the languageless requirement forced me to be creative with conveying information to the player.\n\nA fun fact about Selenia is that it can be played with one hand -- leaving the other hand free to enjoy some freshly squeezed juice :)\n",

It took me a while to figure out shader code, its kinda complicated for my not so great programmer brain (my teammate Mathew usually does the backend coding) I started with the heal sprite where I figured out I needed to convert all the textures for the particles into grayscale for them to be made dissolvable. Now all the particles in the game use shaders to have a cool dissolve effect instead of just fading out of existance. Took me a while to figure out the grayscaling and I had to figure out my teammates work for generating the particles since it created the particle effects via code instead of the inspector node but after some thinking I made it work by making preset shader files and gradients for each individual particle color and type.

I had to figure out how to export the keyframe from the animationplayer so I could change the starting position of the transition using variables which was kinda hard to do understand.

I had to figure out how to pause the notes on command but still allow button inputs and show the interface icons through the icon add-on WHICH ALSO DIDN'T WORK AND I HAD TO FIX IT MYSELF. After figuring out how to pause the rhythm game, attack bar, background music, and melody music I ran into issues with timing the pause in the rhythm game, it would vary by tenths of a second but was enough to throw off the pause. I fixed that by making it send a signal when the note got to the perfect zone, Then I had problems actually making the player hit the note after the prompt since the note kill was attached to the same node as the one I had to pause to hit the note which I fixed with a microdelay after the attack is unpaused kinda scuffed but oh well. THEN THE BACKEND FOR THE RHYTHM ATTACK GOT REWORKED and I had to MANUALLY COPY THE CHANGES AND FIGURE OUT HOW THE NEW SYSTEM WORKED, then I ran into a very strange issue where the the attack never ended on the tutorial scene but ended on the combat scene which took me so many hours to figure out because the code was the EXACT SAME and after many hours I figured out THE STUPID SIGNAL WAS OUTPUTTING TO COMBAT_MAIN INSTEAD OF THE TUTORIAL AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

		"Description": "Prism Maze! A Maze and Platformer in one, played in both 2D and 3D! A mashup game of a mashup of games. I based this game from a little project I made back then for Sprig. You play through a set of levels, from mazes to platformers, unique every gameplay. And I suggest not dying, or else you'll start back at zero (And maybe don't quit too). You play as Prio (I call them a prism-like), the plot is thin here but they we're supposed to be an \"agent\" that aims to beat the levels it gets thrown with and basically train as part of a \"machine learning model\".\n\nI was stumped on what to make that adds a twist on top of the somewhat okay formula. And in one way or another I decided to go 3D, despite me not knowing how to even use Godot for 2D yet. And in a bit I was able to nail the 2D game to something I would say is awesome enough. And then it hit me that I had to do the daunting 3D game in one way or another. A good ponder and UI glow-up later, I was able to start making the 3D Levels.\n\nA few levels later, we got a snappy 2D game with generated mazes, interactive mazes and swift platform levels, and a vast 3D game ranging from petite levels to broad towers. I plan to add a few more touches but this is the game I made and I hope many people can enjoy it!\n",

		"Description": "Spadooshka\nThis is a fast paced 1v1 shooter where players can find items in loot boxes around the map that can be utilized as weapons, or give buffs to players. These items include speed boosts, grenades, health burgers, and more! \nAt the time of writing this, the game is still deep in development. In fact, I'm currently inside our game office (my older brother's old bedroom) with the team working late at night. Our game doesn't look like much right now, with little graphics and no sound effects, but that will absolutely change.\nThe idea for this game literally came on the day of the Juice kickoff, which was inconveniently held at the time of our first Science Olympiad invitational. During the free time we had in between the competition, we struggled to find a game concept that we all felt happy with before the deadline arrived. Eventually, we managed to submit a game idea, but it didn't really resonate with all of us. On the drive back home, one of us discussed an idea she had for a game that worked for everyone. I was at first reluctant since I had no experience in 3D and multiplayer, and thought it'd be too difficult to get into, but we were still passionate and confident in our idea.\nOur game doesn't have a story (it was too difficult to think of one), but it does have a core: pure and utter chaos. Our game's philosophy is to keep players constantly moving on their feet and be prepared for anything. With smooth yet quick movement, players must master the game's controls while utilizing all the random items they've collected to defeat the other player. It's an exhilarating mix between popular modern shooting games and 3D platformers.\n",

		"Description": "It's the year 2027, AI has finally matched human intelligence. After 2 years of faithful employment at Tetsu Incorporated, Coby-SP is finally thrown away and considered, “obsolete.” But Coby also happens to be the first of his kind: persistent. Now he must escape the bowels of his old workplace and make some friends along the way, too. Your job is to navigate the maze-like facility and keep Coby out of trouble, because it isn’t going to be easy.\n\nMaking this game wasn't always fun. In a way, my partner and I were like the character in the game, trying on things we'd never tried before (Godot and GDScript), with no one to help us at all. We gathered with three other people to create this game, but they sadly left due to circumstances early in development, leaving just two people to carry on the dream.\nIt almost felt crazy, setback after setback after setback and deadline after deadline after deadline, with all these what ifs and will we make it…? Boxthings and I grinded the final push to make it all the way to the top, collecting achievements, making progress... (just like Coby.)\nI programmed nearly everything, with Boxthings sending art left and right. We didn't think about what could happen, we thought about what WILL happen.\nAnd at last sweet victory came. We finally drank all 100 hours worth of juice alongside Coby.\n- GB\n",

Most notably, we hadn't figured out what we wanted to do, teammates kept giving up, and Yufan's computer died during most of February. Finally, somewhere around the start of March, we hopped on a call and figured out what we wanted to make. As a fan of base-building/automation games, I really enjoyed the game Mindustry (which is open source!). Similarly, Yufan really enjoyed the game Bloons TD 6. In the end, we decided to cross these two genres, resulting in Obscura. We went with Unity, mainly because Yufan has a lot of experience with it (personally, I would've preferred Godot). Overall, I have learned a lot through making this game, and arguably even more from the adventures this has allowed me to go on.\n",

In this 2-player multiplayer heist, one player becomes the Thief, sneaking around the city and doing his best to collect as much as artifacts, coinbags and postboxes as possible and gets ready to offload his loot towards the end at a shady store but however time is ticking and the Police Officer controlled by the second player is on the mission to chase the thief down and bring justice.\n",

Also added a system to save the final timer score AND the high score to a .save file for later and made a scoreboard scene asw. Fixed some multiplayer issues and got the timer stuff to sync across the devices properly. Also added more collectables to the new maps I made and also added collision to the new maps. I mainly spent a lot of time on fixing these bugs that kept popping up like how the Global variables kept conflicting and how some strings kept coming back as null. Also remade exports for windows and android and fixed the virtual joystick from last session. Btw this was all a midnight grind with lack of sleep or caffeine which probably affected why it took a bit longer. Almost forgot but I also made UI to confirm purchase of food in the game.",

My game is so close to being released as a proto version. There were ALOT of bugs I had to fix every time I added something new so I had to go back to code that clashed and try to make solutions =(\r\n",

		"Description": "Devil's Kitchen\nStory of my game is pretty simple, two friends go for a hike on a nearby mountain, you were hiking up the cliff with your fren but he slips and fells deep down into the valley, so deep that even his painful screeches couldn't be heard. After that you have two choices left, either go home, eat dinner, forget about your friend and sleep, but WAIT you can't do that so you go with the second choice and that is to save your fren. So you follow the arrows, go into a valley, fight some underground mobs, solve some puzzles and save your friend.\n\nseriously idk how this came into my mind, i just started making and ideas kept coming in. Making this game was a significant moment in my life as a developer as earlier i used to run to chatgpt for the smallest coding related problem but i cant do that for game dev, as you have to use real mind here. So yeah after this game, i really started coding things on my own, reading docs and debugging for hours rather than running to AI for every minor inconvenience, so this was huge!\n",

Also at last I fixed the minot bugs like the movement breaking when pressing bottom+right together and the fences going up to the house.

				"description": "Made the sublevel for the next block.\r\n\r\nwait wait wait before you dm me for time related issues, lemme clear why this thing took so much time. What happened is thay I wanted it to be like you go through each vent and then go through a mini level and go to another block, then go to another vent and so....\r\n\r\nSo i simply made a new scene for the first sub level and made everything, after that while connecting both the scenes together i realized that i can't simply play scenes while going from a sublevel to the main level back as it will play the level from start and not go to the next block ever. So i tried fixinf it but i cannot manpulate player's position before the scene is played and it will throw and error most of the times. So i copied the whole new sublevel scene and pasted it in my main scene, and right there my friend i fucked up, both the nodes had some conflicts which made them go kaboom somehow so I had to fix all of them and had to make the sublevel again, so it took this much time. Still you can dm me if you have any problem. \r\n-Manan",

				"description": "Added a new level, made its tilesets and the layout. Made the shard system where we can pick it up and put it in the machine. Made the light system. Fixed a bug, there was a bug which was making the player go teleport multiple times if it passes through the vent twice within the 2 second time period of the teleportation. So i first tried making a local script var system where i can increase the var count by each vent passed and check it before teleportation, but it wasnt giving very good results. So i made a global var system with different variables for all the vents, which is now indeed looking good.",

But however close I got, I could never manage to finish one. I took a tried to teach myself, I watched videos, learned with my friends, and even took game design class. And while I always enjoyed them while time allowed, as soon as they ended, so did my progress. In the face of school, and extracurriculars, and college searching, I could never hold myself accountable to complete what I actually wanted to do FOR myself. Not until I joined hackclub, and took part in Hack Club Juice. This program, for better or for worse, FORCED me give game development a shot, and to stick with it, and I'm so glad it did. Even though I won't be taking part in the Shanghai trip, I'm still proud to have put in the 100 hours time and truly learned how to make time for doing what I love. At this point I've caught the game development bug, and I've caught it hard, so I look forward to seeing the rest of you in the game dev space in the future! \nSigned with love, \nAndre Snellings Jr.\n",

				"description": "I did 3 main things over the course of a long discord call with my fellow developers. I added the ability to level up baubles, and added the ability for their stats to increase when you do so. To do this I added a system in which there are multiple ways for the baubles to receive exp, particularly by defeating enemies, giving them gemstone pickups, or finishing a level. I made it so each of these sources had an emphasis on different stats. So for example, giving a bauble a ruby pickup will give them an emphasis on improving their damage stat, but finishing a level gives a smaller boost, but will give a boost to all stats. Then when the bauble levels up it's take all of these values, and it'll use them to determine what stats actually go up, using a random number generator. I also made it so that the amount of exp needed to level up a bauble increases the higher their level is. I also added the ability for enemies to count how many baubles are attacking them at once. I did this so that I can add different functions to the enemies that they will only do when fewer baubles are attacking or when a lot of baubles are attacking. For now I just made it so that the earthworm can only shoot if less 6 baubles are attacking it. Last thing I did was export the game and create the initial itch page (restricted). The page doesn't have much, but I gave it the bare minimum to function and be usable. The export works but the enemies do not spawn in the exported version, I believe it's an issue with my file names not being case-sensitive.",

This took me a while, not because it was a complicated topic but because I needed to find a good approach. I spent a while reading and trying to implement InputEvents and having the UI accept specific inputs so they cannot go through to the baubles. While this would likely work, I do not have the knowledge of InputEvents to make it function, and eventually decided to pivot to the current strategy.",

The saving took me the longest because I did not know where to start. I ended up finding a solution where each group of info that needed to be stored would be stored in a list in a global variable, then when the scene is reloaded we access that saved data and copy it onto the new scene. This was especially hard for saving the baubles in the party because they were originally stored as the exact nodes they were, and now they need to also be stored as their type and slot because when a new level is loaded, all previous party members are freed, so the type data can help me respawn them when they are needed. Aside from that I also tweaked the tilemap and made some new components (like enemy spawner) so that I can create new levels easier.",

In my case it went from \"Enemies\" at the very beginning, then I renamed it to \"enemies\" months/weeks ago, which is what caused the error to originally appear in the first place, now when I was trying to fix it I needed to rename the file back to \"Enemies\" to fix the error, change it to \"Enemies2\" to have the name change recorded, then change it back to how I wanted it \"enemies\". Basically godot (or git?) doesn't recognize that and uppercase and lowercase name is different, but it could tell the filenames didn't match, so you needed to change it originally to something entirely different in order for it to recognize the difference.

I added a system to reset the game, and a system to end the game for whenever the player leaves or dies. I added an enemy spawner that will spawn a designated number of enemies on a designated timer and will stop when all other enemies are dead or it has spawned the max # of enemies. I restructured the base level script and scene structure to be less unstable. Generally stabilized the game to remove as many red errors as I could find. Reuploaded a new version to itch.

Now if you are holding more than that amount, you will not be able to pick up any more, and any that were automatically picked up will go back to the floor. I fixed bauble throwing to throw one at a time, so if you are holding a stack, they will be thrown one at a time with a certain cooldown between them. I made it so you can't pick up more baubles mid throw (may change). I added a player sprint toggle so they can how run faster if they are not holding baubles. Edited Bauble PATROLLING state to make them stop once they reach the mouse and not stack on top of each other as much. Mostly just messed around with the Bauble throwing behavior and the other parts of the game that it effected, and changed some stuff to fit more cohesively.",

				"description": "I finally added the inventory! It's not fully functional but I need to finish this session haha (sorry cosmin D:). I created a scene for draggable objects which I then turned into an draggable inventory item, then I created inventory slots and party slots that have texture rects for sprites and center containers to hold the control nodes, then created an inventory scene that combines everything, but that broke because the center containers would stop the draggable objects, etc etc etc. Then I fixed all those issues and then added the inventory scene to the main scene... which then made it break again because it was was pinned to a particular part of the scene, so I fixed those issues, by attaching it to the player. I then made some placeholder sprites for item sprites, party slot sprites, and pickup sprites and turned them into resources for the individual scenes. I created a pickup and a signal bus that could be used to add items to the inventory, but I had never used custom signals before so I had to spend a while on that. Then I finally got stuff working at a basic stage... then immediately broke it again when I added the code for instantiating an item in the inventory, which is what I've been fixing for the last 2 hours, particularly I worked on the issue where my control node would shrink to 1x1 when the scene started and I had no Idea why, and initially thought it was just being deleted, yadadadada!

I didn't know what kind of game I was going to do right off the bat. Then, while watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it occurred to me that I could make a game where you escape from a maze :D As I wrote before, I had never made a game, and since Unity is one of the most famous Game engines, I started working in it. Using youtube tutorials I started to learn how to develop games in it. C# was also new to me. The game is still far from finished, but I plan to work on it after juice.\n",

		"Description": "Fishing Fragments\nIt all started on a regular school day. Lunch time comes around, check my emails... BAM a message from Thomas. What was this? I would get the chance to go to China? Make a video game? Get it published on STEAM?????? I was in shock and my heart was racing with excitement. Of course, I was way in over my head, but we'll get back to that. \n\nThe day after the juice call, I open up Godot and was ready to get started. I had an idea from the High Seas Jam that never got past a couple sprites, and I wanted bring this back to life as a full game - of course rethought a bit because of the no language theme. One of my favourite types of minigames found in sandboxes and rpgs is fishing - something about the rush of getting something rare, as well the simplicity of just standing around with your friends. I wanted to base my game around the potential of the fishing minigame with a cozy rpg about a water witch preparing potions (out of fish and other stuff) and getting small trinkets in return from the people she helps. I let this idea stew for about half a month while I worked on schoolwork and got myself accustomed to using GODOT and ASEPRITE. Eventually, I realised that this was not going to work out. I couldn't find a way to have a languageless story to fit this game without much more time than I had.\n\nThis was my first major hurdle, recycling my project for something similar but different. I still wanted to keep fishing as a major aspect, as it can be a rather silent hobby, especially if you're out on a boat for a while without any crew. This led to a new idea. The player would wake up on   boat, no memories, no one to talk to. Fishing to survive, they would catch fragments (pun intended) of who they used to be, their loved ones, and what happened. This would occur through dreams, stumbling upon familiar items or places, and as you filled out your fish compendium. \n\nUnfortunately I grossly overestimated the amount of time I would have, and time I would take implementing each feature. As of now, I don't have much more than a minigame and empty boat to walk around, but I have a roadmap in mind and plan to get the base game done before the end of the month, and update the game further afterwards.\n\nThe one major feature I did implement however, I am VERY happy with. I was always in love with games that have immersive controls and/or ui (Sneaky Sasquatch, NintendoLand, etc.) and fishing has so much potential for this. In Fishing Fragments, you use the mouse wheel to reel the fish in, and I plan on using mouse motion to cast and pull the rod as you would in real life.\n\nOverall, Juice has been one of the best opportunities of my life. Even though I unfortunately won't be in Shanghai, nor will I likely have a full game by deadline, this jam has motivated me to do more game development in 2 months than I ever would have otherwise. Developing Fishing Fragments has also forced me to learn so much more about game development, programming, art, and even how to just plan better. This is my final year in Hackclub, and I am so glad I took part in Juice. Good luck to all future Hackers, and happy Juicing to everyone going to Shanghai!\n",

At first I tried a setter on the loottable item but this didn't actually affect it. I then created a getter for the loottableitem.weight that did the same check, but would return the rarity then instead of setting it. This still didn't work until I realised I had stored the rarities in an enum, and the first value is always 0 in enums, even if you assign it. As I write this I now realise that's why set didn't work and imma go change that because it's technically faster than running the get everytime",

				"description": "made a fishdata resource and integrated it with the fish object. The reason this took so long was because at first I tried to have a scene for each variant of fish. This doesn't work for a couple reasons, exported resources are set to null on object init, so when I create a new fish object, the exported data disappears. Secondly, this kind of defeats the whole point of using resources, since the data needed for each variant already exists as resources. Instead, I added an autoload script (item_manager) which has a function new_fish(type: String) that creates a new fish object and adds the data from a dictionary using type as the key. This also prevents slow initial loading at startup because resources are only loaded as they appear in game. Currently there is only a default fish and a swordfish,  but it should be easier to make new ones now",

To complete things, I ensured that the storage level could spawn in the fish when you enter the scene, this involved a quick spawning script and adding a pickable_object property to item resources for the collision shape.",

		"Description": "You are a goose stranded on Earth. One day, you encounter a golden goose who gives you a daring quest to reclaim the stolen golden egg from the tyrannical duck overlords. Your journey takes you across the plains of Earth, through the Moon’s craters, over Mars’s red deserts spoiled by the ducks’ asteroid machine, past the unforgiving asteroid belt, and finally into a strange, dreamlike realm. Only then, you reach the ducks’ massive mothership. You face the evil black duck in an intense battle, defeat him, and claim the golden egg. With your mission complete, you return the egg to its rightful owner at last. Be ready to be challenged by the vigorous obstacles and puzzling layout of levels! \n\nAs we pondered upon the prompts given to us in that fateful markup document that we had to pitch our game in, there was a flood of bewildering ambition. Being the sadistic psychopaths we are, making players suffer is an obvious inspiration for the game mechanics. However, we also wished the game to be of enough quality such that the players wouldn’t be bored to death in part due to the difficulty. Despite our beating hearts, we had practically zero knowledge in game development with a sophisticated engine like Godot. Nevertheless, we were stably progressing in our initial weeks by flopping between tutorials, improvisation, and some vibe coding sinning. Interestingly, we found our knowledge to grow quite quickly with this model of creation. Though during March break, we were forced to lock in to speed up progress. Throughout this process, we were proud to see our game grow feature by feature, level by level, and our experience grow with the passing of each productive day.\n",

				"description": "Finally figured out what was wrong. Previously, whenever you tried to tune the min_zoom (maximum zoom out before the camera switches back to the \"follow\" model), it would appear as if there was a random y - coordinate that acts as a boundary. Whatever value you set as the min_zoom, the camera would just zoom faster / slower as the player moves in y  such that when the player is at the altitude of that boundary, the zoom of the camera would be the value of the tuned min_zoom, which technically is correct but that was not the point of the code. Now that I fixed it, although nothing appears to be changed, we can now clearly define the bounds of the zoom model for the camera and the follow zoom scale as a variable. Apparently, the position of the camera in the workplace and ChatGPT's misinterpretation is to blame as the values which were being assigned to variables in the code concerning y-positions were relative to the position of the (either terrain or camera), and not a definitive \"y = 0\" in the workspace. Hence, although the code takes in values, say for y = 0, that appear to be correct, it is placed under the wrong context and would cause the player to only switch to the zoom camera mode when it is near the origin position of the terrain instead of the actual \"ground\" that we intended to be y = 0. Hence, we just had to set some offsets. ChatGPT 4o also helped to tackle the issue where the camera transitions were not smooth, and now it is.",

				"description": "Fixed the previously started dyanmic Y-tracking system for the camera by implementing two models:\r\n\r\n1. \"Zoom  model\" In this model, the camera will zoom out to fit both the player and the ground into frame. This model is employed when the player is near the ground. \r\n\r\n2. \"Follow model\": This model is basically the previously added following camera system for Y coordinates (based on partners' following system for X coordinates). However, this time I fixed the offset such that the camera isn't staring into the ground all the time, unlike last time. This model will be used when the player is close to the ground (y = 0)\r\n\r\nThe way the game differentiates between when the player is near the ground or far (and by extension which model of the camera to use) is through computing how much the camera would need to zoom out to fit both the ground and the player into frame. If we need to zoom out more than a predetermined, fixed value representing the maximum zoom, then the \"follow\" model would be used instead. On the other hand, if the computed zoom out factor is in range of the predetermined maximum zoom out scale, the \"zoom\" logic would be used.\r\n\r\nThe switch between the \"follow\" model and the \"zoom\" model ensure that:\r\n\r\na. The player would be able to see what's underneath them (e,g., the spikes, terrain, etc.)  so that they don't just die\r\n\r\nb. The player and terrain becomes more and more insignificant the more the camera zooms out, so we dont want the camera to zoom out indefinitely and for the player not see anything when they either get super high or super low. Hence, the \"follow\" model will be used instead in those conditions.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this will probably be the camera model we will be using. Ima talk to my teammates about this, but in my opinion I am very pround of this as I think that it's very dynamic and it can fit well with basically any terrain we choose to add, whether that's as high as a mountain or a cave. It truly enables us to do some creative stuff with our levels (because it'd be very boring if its just a flat platformer level again and again).",

The game's interpretation of the camera's bounds are different from the location of the camera's actual bounds because it didn't factor in the offset. B. This wasnt noticed last time but when tuning, the camera refuses to go below a certain altitude (more specifically y = 0 plus whatever factors that was applied to it at the time). This is caused because a line of code \"clamping\" the coordinates of the camera was written above all of the conditional statements for handing level changes, and wasnt disputed later. Leaving the code to continue assuming that the level began at x = 0 (which is correct for all parts but the level 3 segment 2), and therefore the level_length to be useless despite being changed.\r\n\r\nThe bugs are now fixed and the camera is tuned properly to fit the level's dimensions.

				"description": "1. Continued furnishing level 3 - all tiles are finished now\r\n\r\n2. Made a teleportation system so that there can be separate \"areas\" inside of levels (like rooms in Mario). Simple, right? NO! Getting the player to teleport is super easy. However, the camera model Im using for this level has a lot of restraints. Often, though the player and camera is teleported to the new zone, the camera instantly begins to move back to its designated area. I tried to make it so that the teleporter can specify some of these values for each instance (so that the camera gets a new set of values for the new area), but it didnt work for a long time because Chatgpt wasnt comprehending it right either. In the end, I had to move the entire segment segment to the right of the first segment instead of under to try if a difference in X would work instead of Y. Ultimately, it worked. I still dont exactly know how, but I think it is because a sufficient amount of the correct variables are updated by the teleporter, in this case most notably probably being the coordinates where the camera registers as the \"base\" of the level's X and Y extents.\r\n\r\nSo far, the camera script is not super tuned, but I believe that this result is robust enough to customise, and I just need to go to sleep rn so Ill work on it tomorrow.",

				"description": "Fixed misaligned hitbox, in particular with the obstacles (hazards). The hitboxes of the obstacles seem seem to have shifted to the right quite entirely, as the death logic never triggered when the player's sprite is directly in contact with the obstacles' hitboxes, rather it was being triggered when in contact with a space on the top of and directly next to the obstacle's sprite on the right. I'd blame the fact that it wasn't me who worked on this so finding wheres where took quite a while, but other than that its a huge red flag when the assets of the obstacle and finish line appears quite distinctly in Godot. Anyways, tons of debugging. Quite a long time apparently now that I look at it on the wrong code, I also asked ChatGPT for what to do, and it constantly suggested that I did something wrong with the assembly and creation of the hitbox in respect to the sprite, hence causing the \"shift\". I checked that along with the code vigourously, making a lot of debugging changes and experiments. Because ChatGPT's instructions were unclear and often guessed, it made it difficult to navigate around Godot's UI and that did take me quite a while, inspecting and searching the project for traces of error related to the obstacle's hitbox. Eventually, I wasn't actually able to identify what caused it, other than find some pretty alarming red flags that I will talk about to my teammate soon. For now, I can say with slight confidence that this was not in fact an issue with setting up the hitbox, rather it was an issue with how the code interpreted it, as A. the obstacle hitbox code varied drastically from that of the finish line hitbox, which for now basically had the same functionings, and B. well, with every debugging feature I have used, I just couldn't identify any issues with setting up the sprite, and C. I redid the entire set up of the obstacles to MAKE SURE that it's not a problem with the set up process and with that I can confirm that it's the code that's wrong. Since I have then identified where in the code the player script handles interpreting the hitbox, (I know why isn't it in its separate code like the finish bar), detecting collision, and calls the death function, I basically put a not incredibly versatile fix to this problem which I have yet to discover the roots of, and that is to manually shift the interpreted hitbox to the left by a fixed amount, which has to be customised each time depending on the application of the obstacle and the size of the sprite, and also did I mention that this was only the horizontal changes, and you have to make changes to the y-vertical interpretations too?!?!!?!!!! Yeah funny, I'll go talk with my partner to see what he was thinking about. Anyways, it worked I guess, good night. ",

				"description": "Gosh that was tolling\r\nAs mentioned before, I gotta fix the hitbox for the goose such that, though it won't be standing on thin air, it wont be \"standing\" on its beak and bottom either. I edited the collision polygon such that it would be more \"slidy\" on the edges and the character would fall off if its sitting on its butt or beak. Unfortunately, that yielded an error. I was confused so I asked ChatGPT, which often is helpful except for this time. I was told that it failed because my shape was either too complex, too concave, or just have two points lying ontop of each other (like last time) or whatever other reasons. Though I failed to provide it context. Turns out, the reason Godot weren't able to \"find\" the polygon of the \"CollisionPolygon2D\" was not because it was invalid, but rather because the script (I think the script?) was placed in the wrong location and thus was referring to a wrong parent. Hence why it's not able to find it. After I moved the files, the duck's collision system started to have errors and resulted in a crash whenever (later I found out) the \"kill enemy\" action was performed by jumping ontop of the enemy, but not exactly on top. It was apparently my fault this time (not my teammates') because when I first got the code I had to introduce new hitboxes while keeping the old ones in the goose scene. Thus why I changed all of the names referring to the changed hitbox to their equivalence changed name (INCLUDING THOSE MENTIONED IN THE DUCKS). For some errors in the ducks' scene (those referencing hitboxes in itself), this caused a problem because its own hitboxes have not been changed, so I basically pointed it to an nonexistant hitbox object / node (I don't know the official term form it). For other(s) (I believe, I forgot how many errors occurred that weren't about wrong names) in the ducks' scene, (I think one most particular that referenced their hitbox, was CHANGED BY CHATGPT IN ITS SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MENTIONING THE POLYGON HITBOX THAT I MISINSTRUCTED IT TO BELIEVE WAS PART OF THE DUCK IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE WAS NO CHANGES TO HITBOXES, LET ALONE A POLYGON HITBOX (THAT IS ONLY ADDED BY ME SO FAR) IN THE DUCKS. And it was likely supposed to refer to the rectangular CollisionShape_2D instead, but by now ChatGPT's suggestion was imbedded the code for far too long of a time and I can't use Control + Z, which means that I can't go and retrieve or see the original code, so then I finally managed to round the problem down and good thing is that ChatGPT gave me a pretty innovated solution using some maths to evaluate an equivalence to the bounds of the original square hitbox (the thing the broken line of code was trying to get), thereby bypassing the reference completely and sparing me from some more hours of suffering. Also there's a funny little line on top for some reason and there's also hitbox problems with some other blocks such as the first two golden blocks placed at the very biginning, along with the spikes. Hopefully fixing those won't take as much trial and error that fixing this hitbox... but it should be fine considering that it was mainly a misplacement error.",

				"description": "Tres bien! Fixed the glitch where the goose would have a \"seizure\" whenever the player releases the duck (crouch) key when there isn't enough space for the goose to return to its default, neck-raised state. This would previously cause it to glitch around the terrain and sometimes even noclip out of bounds into the void. Now, even when the user lets go of the duck (down) keys / buttons, the duck would continue to remain ducking until enough an Area2D node stretching between the top of the hitbox for the ducking goose to the top of the hitbox for the default goose (covering the extended neck, basically) detected supposedly enough space for the goose's neck to be re-extended. This feature is also implemented without interrupting the other movement controls and dynamics in the game, so nothing too big. However, I initially used a CollisionShape2D node, thinking that since similar features are already well-built in the code, that I can just re-use it and instead just integrate it as a slightly more complex if-statement in the already-built ducking function. However, I encountered several logic issues about the if-statement, whether it be the hitbox being over sensitive or not sensitive enough, or just purely sensitive in the wrong ways, I had to make some big fixes. It all came down to nothing though as I found out that my initial hypothesis was actually incorrect; there wasn't any \"collision\" settings in the properties tab, so the goose now cannot go under ANY small, low space due to the hitbox colliding with the terrain, basically making the ducking feature useless. Hence, I reworked the entire thing except this time with an Area2D solution which is something new I learned. Either way, that took slightly less time because it followed a similar approach, only this time with a CollisionShape2D inside of an Area2D. Similar use of the Area2D node technology can also be used in the future for other stuff",

I dont even remember most of them but I suppose it is \r\n\r\n1. Made 8 fully complete levels, including the final boss room\r\n2. Fixed many bugs (I can't recall fully but some significant ones are camera not being able to move above a certain Y-bound despite settings, repeated levels when switching with debug switcher, two players instances spawning, and RID (godot physics engine) overflow, the worst in my opinion). One significant thing done to solve these errors is a centralised camera setting code for each level so that similar errors do not happen again. Made logic for sublevel selector. Made many scenes that can be instantiated (customisable moving platforms, interface teleporters and level transitioners, activatable pistons, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis work was done over a week. Thanks a lot spring break! \r\n\r\nThe video would, I believe, be too long for the juicer to show the entire thing. Here's a YouTube video instead. This video is from a slightly previous version from this same session that has some bugs and does not include the ending but those are fixed now as shown in my video, namely the last moon level, second mars level being broken and general misalignment issues in the new levels. It should also be mentioned that the camera is set to a low zoom for demo purposes and invincibility juice is constantly applied because I dont wanna die mid-recording\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/PeFPXIPcUbw",

So I added abilities, traps, and hopefully eventually enemies.  I started by generating the maze, then created the script that allowed the walls to move. After that I stopped working on the project for the majority of the time, but decided to finish it in the last week. So with 80 hours over the course of a little over a week I began adding features. Art style, main menu, abilities, saving data, audio, ect... Which led to this final product. I plan to continue to work on the game and eventually list it on Steam and a polished and legitimate attempt at making an enjoyable game.\n",

By the time we arrived at the venue, we had already completed a game with that time. However, we quickly realized that the game wasn’t nearly as polished or engaging as we had hoped—it simply wasn’t fun to play.\n\nSo, during the three-day event, we made a bold decision: to start over from scratch.\n\nWith barely any sleep each night, we poured all our energy into building a brand-new game within those 72 hours. What we created durin\n",

		"Description": "Junggle Trek\n\"You find yourself lost in a jungle but you don't know how you ended up there. As you make your way out, mysterious, scary, unexplainable things occur. It sometimes makes your wonder; are you safe in the jungle?\"\n\nThe idea popped in my mind when I went jungle trekking with my family. The experience felt like a never ending maze. Due to the lack of information, we sometimes stumble across forks, and forks, and forks... though we eventually made it out. It was a fun experience with many cool/mysterious encounters on the way (which I will implement further on!)\n\nI decided to make this game because I wanted to learn Unity for the CS project later this year!!! It was confusing at first, but after a few tutorials, I eventually got the hang of it. As of now, it has basic game mechanics like player, title screen and jungle generation.\n\nSadly, juice and jungle must come to an end. Although they may be over, Junggle will keep progressing!! I'm so excited to continue on my journey of making games!!! ^o^\n",

		"Description": "SLIFT\nSLIFT started back in June of 2025 (damn, feels like so long already). I started with absolutely no idea what I wanted to make, I had inspirations, plenty, but a unique idea, zip. Eventually, I turned to the single most reliable source for ideas: Other people. I teamed up with one of my friends, Nio, and we set to brainstorming. Early ideas were vague, we just pulled together a list of our favorite games, and wrote down what made us enjoy them. Unfortunately, we both had completely different ideas about what makes a game fun, I like environmental storytelling games, he likes fast paced, rhythm, horror games. (Nio, if you're reading this, I know there is a ton of overlap, don't roast). Eventually though, we settled on a mix, a fast paced(ish), smooth flowing game, with a focus on environment. Looking back, this might not have been the greatest idea, both of our art skills were severely lacking, and neither of us wanted to do anything somewhat easy, like pixel art (no diss). Regardless, we continued on with planning, and by the time the event started, we had a basic understanding of Godot and a semi functioning player movement.\nA couple weeks into Juice, we were feeling confident enough, blocking out of the levels had been going swimmingly, and we had the first level nearly done and feeling okay. By the turn of the month, we had begun to create art for the first level. Despite our initial ideas, we settled on a pixel art style. I hate doing art, its hard, it takes ages and it never looks good until you're nearly done. Making the art was painful as hell, I started working on the player sprite, spent an hour trying to get the basic shapes, gave up, and restarted. Doing this, several times over, not just for the player sprite, but backgrounds, props, and all the other assets in the game was a truly transformative process. If I had to go through it again, I'd really say to just ignore perfectionism. Don't hunt for that perfect body shape, get it good enough. All the refining can come later.\nTowards the end of juice, the pressure started to set in. Three weeks, no stress, we're on schedule, right? Well, at that point, we drafted up a schedule, and things were looking dire. 5 levels were planned, but we'd only be able to complete three, and even then, we were cutting it close as hell, leaving almost no time for bugfixes and playtesting. We worked hard over that next while (not really any harder than before tbh, just in more of a stressed fashion. Fun fact! I do not in fact work better under pressure. The next while sucked, every day I was just stressing about the game, not about the juice time, but just getting it to a level I could be proud of.\nThat brings me to today. I'm sitting here, on the 31/03/2025. Its a monday night, 7:30pm, this is due at 8 lol. The game’s done for juice, but we've only got three levels. Our plan from here out is not to stop development, we've got a free store page, a pretty decent game, and a plan for what we can do next, look out for the official (full) release of SLIFT sometime soon!\n",

		"Description": "Before the hackathon officially began, we were required to spend 100 hours developing a game in advance. By the time we arrived at the venue, we had already completed a game with that time. However, we quickly realized that the game wasn’t nearly as polished or engaging as we had hoped—it simply wasn’t fun to play.\n\nSo, during the three-day event, we made a bold decision: to start over from scratch.\n\nWith barely any sleep each night, we poured all our energy into building a brand-new game within those 72 hours. What we created during that time is something we’re incredibly proud of. In fact, the core concept of the new game was directly inspired by the theme of the event—Juice.\n",

		"Description": "SpringTime Life\nIt all started on a lazy evening when I was doom-scrolling, pretty fed up with how things were going. All repetitive. I've been following @starthackclub on Instagram for many years but never gathered the courage to take part in something. But I was feeling particularly ambitious that day. When I saw the Juice announcement reel, I just knew I would regret it if I missed this opportunity. This was my chance to do something different. Going to Shanghai has been on my bucket list ever since my dad went there in 2016. Although I never believed I would be able to make a full game by myself and more importantly convince my parents to let me go to China until each day passed with a little more progress. And here we are! As unreal as it seems I did make a little something that reflects my personality and I( a person who isn't allowed to hang out with friends even in nearby places) am going to Shanghai. This is more than a dream come true for me. \nWhen I first thought of a game idea, it wasn't the mechanics but rather a vision of something fun, colourful, engaging and relaxing. As a person born in Spring, I love the season more than anything and I feel it reflects in my personality too. And that is where the name \"SpringTime Life\" comes from! For the game mechanics, I went for something both easy to play and easy to develop since this is my first time making a proper game. Developing this has been nothing but a journey! Full of highs and lows. I had the biggest blow when I lost all my games due to the laptop glitch. Luckily it was only the beginning and I had enough time to rebuild it. And I'm glad it happened because it not only taught me how to keep my code safe but also my rebuilt game turned out to be better than it was originally. \nThe BEST THING about Juice is the community. Every single person here has been so helpful and considerate. From Thomas to the reviewers and my fellow friends. I've made so many friends here. I'm usually hesitant in making online friends but I never felt uncomfortable here. \nLooking forward to meeting all these wonderful people in Shanghai. I hope to make memories that'll last a lifetime!\n",

		"Description": "Signal Lost\nSignal Lost is a 2D space platformer that I made! The story is that the player is an astronaut who crash landed on an alien planet and they need to find the parts to their spaceship which blew apart and reassemble them to return home. But of course, this task isn't easy. The planet is full of confusing paths, limited oxygen, and deadly alien plants! However, all of the aliens on the planet are friendly--if you can speak their language. The player needs to learn to get around on a new planet using the strange gravity and learn the symbols of the alien language to communicate with them! \n\nI got the idea to make this game from the \"languageless\" condition of Juice games. I wanted to somehow take that and make \"languageless\" a core part of my game, so I thought, what's a language that no human would ever understand, and some universal language? Alien language! It's universally unknown to us. And that's where the idea began. \n\nThis is the first \"real\" game I've ever made! I've done some tinkering with games on Scratch before, but never committed to something so huge like this. Over the 100 hours, I definitely had lots of highs and lows. One of the hardest parts of making this game was coding up the alien communication system. There were plenty of tutorial for platformers, making enemies and very general things for games--but the alien communication part was very unique to my game so I really had to understand Godot to make it. After HOURS and HOURS of reading documentation, asking Cursor, and just struggle, I finally got it to work. I think that moment was my biggest \"OMG moment\" and all the work definitely was worth it because it made coding up alien conversations so much easier. Another thing I found fun while building this game was making the art! I previously used Procreate for all my pixel art, but I got Aseprite and learned how to use it--it was awesome!!\n\nOverall, I'm super super proud of how my game is! It's been a LONG journey and it's crazy to think that I started this game TWO months ago with ZERO hours and a totally blank Godot screen. I'm still hoping to make my game EVEN better!! I think I've learned so much from making this game and honestly couldn't have done it with all the motivation and support from people in the Juice channel!! WOW :D\n\n-Estella (@magic frog)\n",

		"Description": "Our idea originally came from a friend who bailed on the project without putting in any hours… It hit us (or rather, him) in the school corridor: a top-down \"level select\" with platformer gameplay, kinda like Cuphead. Nothing too special about it at first.\nThen we thought about copying a game where you can switch between 2D and 3D, but that wasn’t exactly new. So we kept brainstorming—how could we do something similar but different? That’s when the idea of layers hit us. A magician who can switch between different layers of reality…\nFor the engine, we figured a 3D engine like Unity or Unreal made the most sense. We settled on Unreal, planning to write everything in C++, but the only tutorial we found was for Blueprints… so yeah, our project ended up in Blueprints.\nAs for the art—our artist, Leon (who’s actually a dev, but his laptop was too weak for Unreal), had never done art before. His first designs? Questionable, to say the least, but he kept at it. And Maxi, who had never worked with Unreal before, had to figure everything out from scratch, which led to quite a few struggles early on.\nBut to be fair, both of them really pulled through in the end. Leon’s art improved massively, turning into something genuinely cool, and Maxi got the hang of Unreal, making things actually work. Those last two weeks? Everything just clicked. Suddenly, the game felt like it was coming together, and we finally saw our idea take shape.\nOh, and the cutscenes? We forced a friend to do them. Just like we forced another friend to make the music. And honestly? Both turned out AWESOME.\nIn the end, our game was barely a third of what we originally planned. But hey, it met the requirements—so that’s something, right?\n",

This dungeon will be divided into two sections: one that lies deeper underground—hence the red color scheme—and another at a more typical cave height. However, the process of creating it was more complicated than I initially expected, as I had to redo the tileset multiple times.  \r\n\r\nAt first, I designed it in a 48x48 resolution, but I later found out that this size isn’t ideal for Unreal Engine (source: Maximilian). So, I remade it in 64x64 pixels. However, I quickly realized that this resolution was too detailed compared to the other assets, which are all 16x16. In the end, I recreated the entire tileset in 16x16.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for the \"slightly\" longer session—it was a hell of a lot of work!)",

		"Description": "Mama's Jiaoziria\nI started Juice initially with lots of optimism and excitement. I was ready to start steadfast. That is until I was met with the unfortunate news that I could not in fact go to Shanghai, China. Nothing was stopping me except well- my parents. I held out hope that maybe their mind would changed but I felt stuck. I wanted to create a cool project and go to a cool event and it definitely felt like all hope was lost. But I realized even if I'm not in Shanghai, i can still help make that cool project. Me and my friend teamed up and we had a lot of ideas in the beginning. We had this idea of a dreamscape that the user had to explore - it was a good idea but it was using the 3D world of Godot (which me and my friend were both unfamiliar with). It was clear to us that maybe it was time to shift gears so I (the most genius Einstein to have ever lived) came up with the idea that we mimic a Papa's Pizzeria game. And mimic we did because the idea was great! It also was nice because we got to add a little touch of Chinese culture in the mix, appealing to the people playing our games in Shanghai China. \nObviously there are SOO many challenges in the game making process but I appreciated the moments where I was able to look at the progress me and my teammate made and say \"we did this.\" \nI was in charge in mainly of the art and I'll admit there were times I was slacking but I think I'm really proud of all the progress I've made and considering I put a lot of effort into something that I was unfamiliar with. I'm not too keen on digital art and using an actual art software was difficult at first but putting in the work, learning new things, made this process all the more worthwhile. AND the art is so super duper fire. Our game has a little \"hidden\" easter egg as well so be on the look out of that :) (hint: it's a filling type for the dumpling... wonder what that could mean....).\nI also want to take this time to share how much I value my teammate as well. Issac is such a good partner in crime and seeing his dedication and commitment to Juice made me appreciate the hard work, time, and effort he was putting into the code/project as well.\nTo end it off, I'd also like to say I'm extremely proud of myself as well. There are challenges I never expected to arise out of this project, challenges where I had to teach myself new things, but hey, as Thomas always says \"in life we are always learning,\" and I think that's the joy of it.\n",

I will be completely honest here: after making my game for 100 hours, I'm sick of it and I probably won't update it. But I'm not giving up on making games, I'm going to make a new one. Over the course of making my game, I had a lot of motivation at the beginning, but by the time I had worked on my game for 50 hours, my motivation was really low. I didn't work on my game for almost a week, but then I had lots of good ideas for my game and I worked on those. I finished the 100 hours right before the deadline.\n",

				"description": "ok i know this stretch is REALLY long but this took so long to do. i noticed that the player was not respawning at all on the unknown block level, and neither was the r key or ui button, and all enemies in general. The most part of this stretch was just trying stuff in the script and seeing if it worked, and at one point i rewrote the respawn function, but nothing worked. i even resorted to asking ai, but that didnt do anything. then i merged the script into player movement, but that didn't work. i knew that it was working and it was colliding, because the blocks turned green or red, it just wasnt respawning. I have no idea how this worked, but to fix it, i just used an empty gameobject for respawn refrence instead of typing in the axises in the inspector. but this only fixed the unknown block level, and the r key still did not work. i was using some legacy stuff, so i updated that and it worked. but the unknown blocks respawn didn't fully work, even though it respawned, it wasnt immidiate most of the time and the player could skip over death blocks. so after a while of trying to figure out what was wrong, i noticed that the player was falling a tiny bit and not colliding yet. to fix this, i changed the script to have an axis sort of thing, where it just detected the tag the axis under the player. after a few iterations of getting this to work, everything works now!!!!!",
